Sales\\nand other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by\\ndelivering advertising on: \\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search\\ndistribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and\\noperated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \\u2022 YouTube properties; and \\u2022 Google Network properties,\\nincluding revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Our customers\\ngenerally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & Video 360, and Google\\nMarketing Platform, among others. We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We\\nrecognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we\\nrecognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad. For ads placed on Google Network properties, we\\nevaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net\\nbasis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is,\\nthe amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded\\nas cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our\\ncustomers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred\\nto our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of\\ndiscretion in establishing pricing. Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and\\ndevices revenues consist of revenues from: 57. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. \\u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily\\ninclude revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as\\nGoogle One; \\u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; \\u2022\\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and \\u2022 other products and services. Subscription\\nrevenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues from Google\\nPlay sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction\\nbetween app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee. Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues\\nconsist of revenues from: \\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for\\ninfrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including\\nour AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics; \\u2022 Google\\nWorkspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as\\nCalendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and \\u2022 other\\nenterprise services. Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may\\nhave contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are\\nrecognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to\\ncloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives\\nand consumes the benefits of the cloud services. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with\\ncustomers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance\\nobligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the\\nprices charged to customers. Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits,\\nwhich are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided\\nto customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable\\nconsideration related to customer incentives and credits. Sales Commissions We expense sales commissions when incurred\\nwhen the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and\\namortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing\\nexpenses. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues. \\u2022 TAC includes: \\u25e6 amounts paid\\nto our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include\\nbrowser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and \\u25e6 amounts paid to\\nGoogle Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \\u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \\u25e6 content\\nacquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for\\ndistribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated,\\nsubscriber counts, or a flat fee); \\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; 58. Table of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc. \\u25e6 employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as\\ncontent review and customer and product support; \\u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and \\u25e6 other\\ntechnical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs. Software Development\\nCosts We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of\\nproducts to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological\\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet\\nthe criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include\\ncosts to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our\\nservices. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is\\ncomplete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function\\nintended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\\nStock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs).\\nRSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize\\nRSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as\\nthey occur. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying\\naward, and settled in Class C shares. For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory\\nincome tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number\\nof RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market\\nconditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards\\ngranted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period.\\nCertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement.\\nThe fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet\\ncompany. Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they\\nare incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled\\napproximately $ 9.2 billion, $ 8.7 billion, and $ 8.7 billion, respectively. Performance Fees Performance fees refer to\\ncompensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments. We record compensation\\nexpense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment\\nreturns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are\\nrecorded as a component of OI&E. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would\\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value\\nhierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: Level 1 -\\nObservable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2\\n- Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\\nsimilar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant\\ninputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, 59. Table of\\nContents Alphabet Inc. these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using\\nmarket-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level 3 -\\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to\\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The\\ndetermination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial\\nassets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets\\nand liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required. We measure certain other instruments, and\\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Financial\\nInstruments Our financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities,\\nderivative financial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. Credit Risks We are subject to credit risk\\nprimarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign\\nexchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely\\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange\\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are\\ntypically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit\\nrisk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we\\nextend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. Cash Equivalents We invest excess cash primarily in\\nasset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, government bonds, money market funds, and time\\ndeposits. Marketable Securities We classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three\\nmonths or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three\\nmonths as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our\\ninvestments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet\\ndate. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of\\nour risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to\\ntheir effective maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly\\nliquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of\\ntaxes, as a component of stockholders\\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are\\nrecorded in OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in\\nfair value are recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on\\na specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E. Our investments in\\nmarketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including unrealized,\\nrecognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions beyond 12\\nmonths as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Non-Marketable Securities Non-marketable\\nsecurities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we\\nexercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Other non-marketable\\nequity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement\\nalternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from\\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments\\nare determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of OI&E.\\n60. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Non-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are\\nclassified as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments See Note 3\\nfor the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. Accounts Receivable Our payment terms for\\naccounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services offered. The term\\nbetween invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customers, we require\\npayment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts receivable includes\\namounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer. We maintain an allowance for credit\\nlosses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are\\nclassified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by\\nreviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when\\nwe identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance\\nfor credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the\\ncreditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information,\\ncurrent market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Convertible Notes Our\\ninvestments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances,\\ndeferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included\\nwithin other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Our financial instruments also include debt\\nand equity investments in companies with which we also entered into commercial arrangements at or near the same time.\\nFor these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the substance of the arrangements, including assessing whether\\nthe components of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and\\ndetermining the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally,\\nif our investment in such companies becomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial\\narrangement, including reducing any remaining performance obligations. Impairment of Investments We periodically review\\nour debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we\\ndetermine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering available information relevant to\\nthe collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\\nforecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized\\nlosses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not\\nthat we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost\\nbasis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. For\\nnon-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment indicators exist\\nby evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators.\\nIf the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording\\nthe corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity\\ninvestments using a market approach or an income approach. Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and\\nis stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method. Variable\\nInterest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an\\ninvestment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate\\nVIEs when we are 61. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE\\nwhen we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have\\nthe obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we\\naccount for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Periodically, we\\nassess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the\\nentity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is\\ncomprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in service, and assets not yet\\nin service. Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and leasehold improvements, and servers and\\nnetwork equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service\\nare those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and servers in the process of\\nconstruction or assembly. Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation\\ncommences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated\\nuseful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned\\nuse and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate\\nservers and network equipment generally over a period of six years . We depreciate corporate and other assets over\\nperiods of two to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the\\nestimated useful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on\\nthe expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when\\nchanges in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair\\nvalue allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were no t material for the\\nperiods presented. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain\\nlease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components\\nprimarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and\\nliabilities. Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and\\npayments for maintenance and utilities. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future\\nlease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease\\npayments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily\\ndeterminable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis\\nwith similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include\\nperiods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\\nWe generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets\\nalso include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are included on our\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and\\nother current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets\\nare included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other\\ncurrent liabilities or other long-term liabilities. Operating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\\nover the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the\\nincremental borrowing rate. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review leases, property and equipment, and intangible\\nassets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not\\nbe recoverable. The evaluation is performed 62. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. at the lowest level of identifiable cash\\nflows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the\\nfuture undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the\\nassets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying\\nvalue exceeds its fair value. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which\\nwe recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for\\nthe future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure\\ncurrent and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of\\nfuture realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to\\nreduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation\\nallowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to\\naccount for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense. We recognize\\nthe financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the\\nposition will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are\\nthen measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with\\na taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component\\nof the income tax provision. Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we\\nacquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and\\nliabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in\\naccordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable\\nassets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business\\ncombination and are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency We translate the financial statements of our international\\nsubsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period\\nderived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI\\nas a component of stockholders\\u2019 equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the\\nconversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in\\nOI&E. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards\\nBoard (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 \\\"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\\nDisclosures\\\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose\\nadditional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be\\nrequired to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements.\\nThe standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual\\nperiod and are currently assessing the effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement\\ndisclosures. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \\\"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense\\nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\\\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\\u2019s expenses. Upon adoption, we\\nwill be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories\\nincluded within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual\\nperiod, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied either\\nprospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the updated standard\\nwill have on our financial statement disclosures. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB\\nissued ASU No. 2023-07 \\u201cSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\u201d which expands\\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\\nsignificant segment expenses. We adopted this ASU for our 2024 annual period with the comparative periods updated to\\nreflect additional disclosures. See Note 15 for further details.

Revenue Backlog As of December\\n31, 2024, we had $ 93.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\\u201crevenue backlog\\u201d), primarily related to Google\\nCloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been\\nrecognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\\nmonths with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition\\nfor these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when\\nour customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts\\nthat will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and\\ncancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance\\nof our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $ 5.0 billion, of which\\n$ 3.9 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. Total deferred revenue as of December 31,\\n2024 was $ 6.0 billion. Note 3. Financial Instruments 64. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Fair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are\\nmeasured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted\\nprices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in\\nactive markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy,\\nbecause we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option\\nfor which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align\\nwith the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are\\ninvestments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments\\nof the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on\\nobservable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity\\nsecurities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include\\noption pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination\\nof the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected\\ntime to exit, risk free rate, and the rights and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly\\nbased on investment type. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $ 35.5\\nbillion, of which $ 19.9 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and were\\nprimarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in\\nperiods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic\\nnet gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period.

Our convertible notes held for investment are recorded at\\namortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or\\npremium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets. 68. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to\\nmanage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use\\nforeign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will\\nbe adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to\\npartially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value\\nhierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written\\noptions) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for\\nderivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward\\nand option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions\\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow\\nhedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to\\nrevenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of\\nhedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The\\ndifference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in\\nAOCI. As of December 31, 2024 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\\n$ 731 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable\\nsecurities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of\\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We\\nexclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\\nOI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the\\nforeign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the\\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We\\nexclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\\nOI&E. Other Derivatives We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging\\ninstruments to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other\\nthan the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as\\naccounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\\nliabilities. We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives\\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \\u201cother\\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details. 69. Table of\\nContents Alphabet Inc.

These leases will commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease terms between\\none and 25 years. Note 5. Variable Interest Entities Consolidated VIEs 73. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We\\nconsolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and\\nfinancial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs,\\ntheir assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024,\\nassets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $ 4.9 billion and $ 8.7 billion, respectively and\\nare primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and\\n2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.3 billion, respectively.\\nWe may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Waymo, a fully\\nautonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $ 5.6 billion in funding during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2024, the majority of which was funded by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were accounted for as\\nequity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, total\\nnoncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $ 3.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion, respectively, of\\nwhich $ 1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within\\nadditional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented\\nand is included within the \\\"other\\\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We\\nhave investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are\\nprimarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using\\nrenewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the\\nactivities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary,\\nand the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial\\nstatements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments,\\nwhich are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these\\nunconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding\\ncommitments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments\\nwere $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion, respectively. Note 6. Debt Short-Term Debt We have a debt financing program of up\\nto $ 10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general\\ncorporate purposes. We had no c ommercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and $ 2.3 billion of commercial\\npaper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.4 % as of December 31, 2024 .The estimated fair\\nvalue of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2024 Our short-term debt balance also\\nincludes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

The notes in the\\ntable above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any\\ntime in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received\\nwith interest payable semi-annually. The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $ 10.3\\nbillion and $ 9.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined\\nbased on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as\\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2024, the future principal payments for long-term debt were as\\nfollows (in millions): 2025 $ 1,000 2026 2,000 2027 1,000 2028 0 2029 0 Thereafter 8,000 Total $ 12,000 Credit Facility\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $ 10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $ 4.0 billion expires in April\\n2025 and $ 6.0 billion expires in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a\\nformula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goa ls. No\\namounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Note 7.

Note 8.\\nBusiness Combinations character.ai In accordance with the accounting requirements under Accounting Standards\\nCodification Topic 805, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $ 2.7 billion of goodwill and $ 413 million of\\nintangible assets resulting from a transaction with character.ai (\\u201cCharacter\\u201d). In August 2024, we entered into a\\nlicense agreement with Character pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to its then current large\\nlanguage model technology. We paid Character $ 2.7 billion in cash and canceled our convertible instruments. We also\\nhired certain employees of Character. Goodwill was recorded in Google Services and Google Cloud and is deductible for\\ntax purposes. Note 9.

Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We have content licensing agreements with future\\nfixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $ 8.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid\\nquarterly through the first quarter of 2030. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate\\ntransactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers,\\nGoogle Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with\\nrespect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a\\nbreach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against\\ncertain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the\\namount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and\\nour bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate\\nof the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances\\ninvolved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that\\nvalid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material\\nadverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2024, we did not\\nhave any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Legal Matters We record a liability\\nwhen we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we\\ndetermine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably\\npossible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been\\npreviously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as\\nappropriate. Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine\\nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be\\nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are\\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have\\na material adverse effect. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Antitrust Matters We are\\nsubject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition matters by\\nregulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the\\nfollowing: \\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a \\u20ac 2.4 billion\\nfine. We appealed the EC decision and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into 78. Table of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc. compliance with the EC's decision. In September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal\\nand upheld the \\u20ac 2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $ 3.0 billion for the fine. \\u2022\\nAndroid: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\\u2019s Android-related distribution\\nagreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \\u20ac 4.3 billion fine, and directed the termination of the conduct\\nat issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. In\\nSeptember 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the fine from \\u20ac 4.3 billion to \\u20ac 4.1 billion. We\\nsubsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which\\nremains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $ 5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $ 217 million in\\n2022. \\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's agreements\\nwith AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \\u20ac 1.5 billion, and directed\\nactions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. In 2019, we\\nrecognized a charge of $ 1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In September 2024, the General Court\\noverturned the EC decision and annulled the \\u20ac 1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with\\nthe European Court of Justice. \\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a\\nlawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws\\nrelating to Search and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled\\nthat Google violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of\\nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and\\nservices and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements,\\namong other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have filed our own remedies\\nproposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect a decision likely in the second half of 2025, after\\nwhich we intend to appeal. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October\\n2023, the Japanese Fair Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices. Given the\\nnature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss. \\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of\\nstate Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that\\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a\\ntrial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys\\nGeneral, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated\\nU.S. antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General\\nsubsequently joined the lawsuit. The trial ended in September 2024, and we expect a decision in early 2025. Further, in\\nJune 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated\\nEuropean antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. Given the nature of these\\nmatters, we cannot estimate a possible loss. \\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a\\nlawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Google\\u2019s operation of Android\\nand Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we\\nreached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final\\napproval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow\\nagent. In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated U.S.\\nantitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a\\nremedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and\\ncontractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily\\npaused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of\\nthe remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\\n79. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. \\u2022 European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations\\nregarding Google's compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search.\\nGiven the preliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss. In addition to these proceedings,\\nprivate individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the\\nU.S. and in several other jurisdictions. We believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend\\nourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other\\nregulators around the world. Privacy Matters We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we\\ncurrently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example,\\nthere are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and\\nuse of location information, alleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising\\npractices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. Patent and Intellectual Property\\nClaims We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become\\nan important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a\\nprohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on\\nimportation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the\\nU.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our customers and partners\\nmay discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which\\ncould result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Other We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory\\nand government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual\\nproperty, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content\\ngenerated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury,\\nconsumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant\\nregulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and\\nother proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing\\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral\\nrelated civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results. We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern\\ncivil judgments that include compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination\\nof accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material\\nadverse effect. Non-Income Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-\\nincome tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and\\ntax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain\\nemployee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with,\\nthese tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably\\npossible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent\\ncomplexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be\\nmaterially different from our expectations. See Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies. 80. Table of\\nContents Alphabet Inc. Note 11. Stockholders' Equity Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our\\nBoard of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock.\\nThe rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting.\\nEach share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to\\n10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we\\nrepurchased $ 59.3 billion, $ 62.2 billion, and $ 62.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $ 70.0\\nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $ 44.7 billion remained available for Class A and\\nClass C share repurchases. The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired\\n(in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2024 Shares Amount Shares Amount Class A share\\nrepurchases 78 $ 9,316 73 $ 11,855 Class C share repurchases 450 52,868 306 50,192 Total share repurchases (1) 528 $\\n62,184 379 $ 62,047 (1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases. Repurchases are executed from time to time,\\nsubject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or\\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an\\nexpiration date. Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash dividends, which were first paid in June\\n2024, were $ 3.5 billion, $ 519 million, and $ 3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively. The\\ncompany intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company\\u2019s Board of\\nDirectors in its sole discretion. Note 12. Net Income Per Share We compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and\\nClass C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of\\nshares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of\\nshares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities\\nconsist of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently\\nissuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation\\nof the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net\\nincome per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. In accordance with our certificate of\\nincorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and\\nClass C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our\\ncertificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying\\nunequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that\\namendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or\\npreferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed\\namendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a\\nstockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. 81. Table of Contents Alphabet\\nInc. Immaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due to the\\nallocation of distributed earnings, which is based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of\\nundistributed earnings and number of shares, which is based on the weighted average shares outstanding over the periods.\\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class\\nC stock (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2022 Class A Class B Class C Consolidated Basic\\nnet income per share: Numerator Allocation of distributed earnings (cash dividends paid) $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Allocation of\\nundistributed earnings 27,518 4,072 28,382 59,972 Net income $ 27,518 $ 4,072 $ 28,382 $ 59,972 Denominator Number of\\nshares used in per share computation 5,994 887 6,182 13,063 Basic net income per share $ 4.59 $ 4.59 $ 4.59 $ 4.59\\nDiluted net income per share: Numerator Allocation of total earnings for basic computation $ 27,518 $ 4,072 $ 28,382 $\\n59,972 Reallocation of total earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A shares 4,072 0 0 _ (1)\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings ( 230 ) ( 30 ) 230 _ (1) Net income $ 31,360 $ 4,042 $ 28,612 $ 59,972\\nDenominator Number of shares used in basic computation 5,994 887 6,182 13,063 Weighted-average effect of dilutive\\nsecurities Add: Conversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding 887 0 0 _ (1) Restricted stock units and other\\ncontingently issuable shares 0 0 96 96 Number of shares used in per share computation 6,881 887 6,278 13,159 Diluted net\\nincome per share $ 4.56 $ 4.56 $ 4.56 $ 4.56 (1) Not applicable for consolidated net income per share. 82.

Compensation Plans Stock Plans Our stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated\\n2021 Stock Plan (\\\"Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan\\\") and Other Bets stock-based plans. Under our stock plans, RSUs and other\\ntypes of awards may be granted. Under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our\\nClass C stock at the time the award vests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting\\ndate. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award,\\nand settled in Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, there were 633 million shares of Class C stock reserved for\\nfuture issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan. Stock-Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2022,\\n2023, and 2024, total SBC expense was $ 19.5 billion, $ 22.1 billion, and $ 22.8 billion, including amounts associated\\nwith awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $ 18.8 billion, $ 21.7 billion, and $ 22.0 billion, respectively.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we recognized tax benefits on total SBC expense, which are\\nreflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $ 3.9 billion, $ 4.5 billion,\\nand $ 4.6 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, tax benefit realized related to\\nawards vested or exercised during the period was $ 4.7 billion, $ 5.6 billion, and $ 6.8 billion, respectively. These\\namounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit. Stock-\\nBased Award Activities The following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs, which include dividend\\nequivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share\\namounts): Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested as of December 31, 2023 338 $ 104.93 Granted\\n195 $ 140.04 Vested ( 199 ) $ 110.89 Forfeited/canceled ( 35 ) $ 113.52 Unvested as of December 31, 2024 299 $ 122.77\\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 was $\\n127.22 and $ 97.59 , respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years\\nended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, were $ 23.9 billion, $ 26.6 billion, and $ 33.3 billion, respectively. As of\\nDecember 31, 2024, there was $ 34.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is\\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

If not utilized, the federal net\\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire\\nin 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033. It is more likely than not that the\\nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject\\nto various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024 , our Federal\\nand California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $ 700 million\\nand $ 6.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the California\\nR&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the federal tax credit and state tax credit is\\nnot likely to be realized. As of December 31, 2024 , our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax\\npurposes were approximately $ 1.2 billion and will begin to expire in 2030. We use the flow-through method of accounting\\nfor investment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized. As of December 31, 2024, we\\nmaintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating losses,\\ncertain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to Other Bet companies, and certain\\nforeign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining\\nvaluation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a\\ntax benefit will be recorded accordingly. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $ 18.9 billion, $ 19.2\\nbillion, and $ 27.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. 86.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 7.1 billion, $\\n9.4 billion, and $ 12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 , 2023, and 2024, respectively, of which $ 5.3 billion, $ 7.4\\nbillion, and $ 10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. As of December 31, 2023\\nand 2024, we accrued $ 622 million and $ 1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes,\\nrespectively. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.\\nOur two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our\\nincome tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax\\nreturns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments\\nor permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented. The tax years 2016 through 2023 remain\\nsubject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits\\nin various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of\\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We\\ncontinue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected\\nexpiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been\\nmade for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted\\nwith certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's\\nexpectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur.\\nAlthough the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably\\npossible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially\\nchange in the next 12 months. Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as\\nGoogle Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android,\\nChrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from\\nadvertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\\nNFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices. \\u2022 Google Cloud includes\\ninfrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates\\nrevenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google\\nWorkspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of\\nmultiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from\\nthe sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with\\ncontent and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are\\ndirectly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as\\ntechnical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including\\nthe associated depreciation, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount,\\nor revenue. 87. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. As announced in April 2024, we consolidated teams that focus on building\\ngeneral AI models across Google Research and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. General AI model\\ndevelopment teams previously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are reported within Alphabet-level\\nactivities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024. As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app\\nteam that is developing the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated\\nwith the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Services segment. Certain costs are not allocated to\\nour segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared\\nR&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic\\nactivities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and\\nsettlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not\\nallocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating\\nincome (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to assess the performance of our\\nsegments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with\\nthe participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered\\nby this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer\\nconcluded that, as of December 31, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance\\nlevel and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we\\nfile or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified\\nin the SEC\\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\\ndisclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management\\u2019s Report on Internal\\nControl over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal\\nControl\\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\\nframework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\\neffective as of December 31, 2024. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance\\nCommittee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited\\nby Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in\\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and\\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how\\nwell designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and\\nthat management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures\\nrelative to their costs.

EX-19.01 2 googexhibit1901q42024.htm EX-19.01\\nDocument Exhibit 19.01 Alphabet's Policy Against Insider Trading Employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its\\nsubsidiaries (\\u201c Alphabet \\u201d), their immediate family members (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, children, and parents) or\\nother people living in the same household, and their controlled entities (trusts that they control or benefit from, or\\npartnerships or other entities they control) (collectively, \\u201c Covered Persons \\u201d) may not do any of the following: \\u25cf\\ntrade securities of Alphabet while having material nonpublic information related to Alphabet, unless the trade is made\\nthrough Alphabet\\u2019s Employee Trading Plan program [link] or a plan approved under Alphabet\\u2019s 10b5-1 Trading Plan\\nGuidelines [link], \\u25cf trade securities of any other company while having material nonpublic information about or that may\\naffect that company acquired through an Alphabet role or relationship, \\u25cf \\u201ctip\\u201d others about material nonpublic\\ninformation that involves Alphabet or other companies and that was gained through an Alphabet role or relationship, or \\u25cf\\notherwise violate insider trading laws. This Policy applies until a Covered Person is no longer providing services to\\nAlphabet and no longer has any material nonpublic information subject to this Policy. Consultants and contractors\\nworking with Alphabet are not directly subject to this Policy, but should comply with applicable securities laws against\\ninsider trading, as well as contractual obligations regarding the handling of Alphabet confidential information.\\nDefinitions \\u201c Material \\u201d Information is information a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether\\nto buy or sell securities. Either positive or negative information may be material. As a general rule, information\\nlikely to affect the market price of a security is likely material. Some examples of the types of information that may\\nbe material: \\u25cf Financial results \\u25cf News of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition or disposition \\u25cf Significant\\ndevelopments involving major corporate relationships, such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships \\u25cf Changes\\nin dividend policy \\u25cf Proposed stock splits \\u25cf New product announcements of a significant nature \\u25cf Significant\\ncybersecurity incidents \\u25cf New equity or debt offerings \\u25cf Positive or negative developments in litigation or\\ninvestigations \\u25cf Major changes to senior management Financial information is particularly likely to be material. For\\nexample, nonpublic information about the results of Alphabet\\u2019s operations for even part of a quarter might be material\\nin helping to predict Alphabet\\u2019s results for the quarter. \\u201c Nonpublic \\u201d information is information that has not been\\nwidely disseminated to the public market long enough for the public to absorb and evaluate it. \\u201c Securities \\u201d of\\nAlphabet or other companies include equity securities (e.g., Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C capital\\nstock), restricted stock units, performance stock units, stock options, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants,\\nconvertible debentures, and derivative securities (including exchange-traded options). \\u201c Tipping \\u201d is sharing material\\nnonpublic information with another person or making recommendations or expressing opinions about trading in the impacted\\nsecurities on the basis of such information (even if the information itself is not shared). \\u201c Trading \\u201d includes\\ndirectly or indirectly buying, selling, pledging, or otherwise acquiring or disposing of securities, as well as agreeing\\nto do any of these things. While bona fide gifts and donations are generally permitted during open trading windows, a\\ngift of securities can constitute trading if there is an arrangement (written or otherwise) with the recipient to sell\\nsuch securities. Other Restrictions Trading Windows Employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries\\nand their controlled entities may not trade, give, or donate Alphabet securities when their applicable trading window is\\nclosed unless they do so through Alphabet\\u2019s Employee Trading Plan program [link] or under a plan approved under\\nAlphabet\\u2019s 10b5-1 Trading Plan Guidelines [link] Trading windows for Alphabet employees depend on their level: \\u25cf The\\nquarterly trading window for individuals at Employee Level 8 (Directors) and above (including officers and directors)\\nand their controlled entities opens on the second trading day following the public disclosure of Alphabet\\u2019s financial\\nresults for the prior fiscal quarter and ends at the close of market on the first trading day of the third calendar\\nmonth of the current quarter. \\u25cf The quarterly trading window for individuals at Employee Level 7 and below and their\\ncontrolled entities opens on the second trading day following the public disclosure of Alphabet\\u2019s financial results for\\nthe previous fiscal quarter and ends at the close of market on the first trading day of the next fiscal quarter. Even\\nduring an open trading window, employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries (and their controlled\\nentities) with material nonpublic information relating to Alphabet may not trade Alphabet securities until at least the\\nsecond trading day after such information becomes public. Alphabet\\u2019s Insider Trading Compliance Officer may designate\\nspecial trading restriction periods for individuals having material nonpublic information, such as news of a pending\\nmaterial acquisition. Alphabet will notify individuals subject to a special trading restriction. Those persons may not\\ninform others of the notification or any material inside information, and they (and their controlled entities) may not\\nengage in any transaction involving Alphabet\\u2019s securities until instructed otherwise by the Insider Trading Compliance\\nOfficer. Alphabet\\u2019s quarterly trading windows and special trading restriction periods do not apply to family members or\\nother persons living in the same household as the employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries.\\nHowever, any family members and other persons living in the same household as the employees, officers, and directors of\\nAlphabet or its subsidiaries are strongly advised to adhere to the applicable trading window as well as any special\\ntrading restriction periods that may apply to the employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries.\\nAlphabet\\u2019s Insider Trading Compliance Officer has the authority to determine who will be subject to Alphabet\\u2019s trading\\nwindows, and may modify the list of Alphabet persons subject to the quarterly trading windows and/or special trading\\nrestriction periods from time to time. Other Prohibited Transactions Covered Persons may not engage in short-term (\\u201cin\\nand out\\u201d) trading, short sales, hedging, or other derivative transactions involving Alphabet securities, pledge Alphabet\\nsecurities as collateral, hold Alphabet securities in margin accounts, or place limit orders or stop orders for Alphabet\\nsecurities that are likely to remain open during a closed trading window or other restricted period. Pre-clearance\\nOutside of an approved 10b5-1 trading program, members of Alphabet\\u2019s Board of Directors and all of Alphabet\\u2019s Section 16\\nofficers may not trade Alphabet\\u2019s securities, even during an open trading window, without first having the transaction\\npre-cleared by Alphabet\\u2019s Insider Trading Compliance Officer. Exemptions These restrictions do not apply to the: (i)\\nexercise of Alphabet stock options when the exercise price is paid in cash (\\u201ccashless\\u201d exercises of stock options are\\ncovered by this Policy); (ii) transactions involving only a change in the form of ownership (e.g., a person transferring\\nshares to a trust of which he or she is the sole beneficiary); (iii) mandatory sales of shares under non-US stock award\\nagreements or under 409A exercise elections; or (iv) grants of stock, options, or restricted stock units from Alphabet.\\nPolicy Violations Individuals who trade on material nonpublic information (or tip such information to others) are\\nsubject to civil and criminal penalties. Violations of this Policy by Alphabet employees may also result in demotion,\\ntermination, or other disciplinary actions. This Policy goes beyond legal requirements, and Alphabet may determine that\\nspecific conduct violates this Policy, even if it does not violate the law, and may take disciplinary action prior to\\nthe filing or resolution of any civil or criminal action against the alleged violator.

Members are billed in\\nadvance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership\\nperiod. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that 43 Table of Contents are collected from members and remitted to\\ngovernmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer\\nelectronics (\\\"CE\\\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\\\"MVPDs\\\"), mobile operators and internet\\nservice providers (\\\"ISPs\\\"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its\\nmembers. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone\\nprice for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as\\nrevenue. The Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products, live\\nevents and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material\\ncomponent of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the\\nconsolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing\\nexpenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales\\npartners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Sales and marketing expenses also include\\npayroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company's\\nadvertising sales and marketing activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include promotional\\nactivities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising expenses were $ 1,779 million, $ 1,732 million and $\\n1,586 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Income Taxes The Company records a\\nprovision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset\\nand liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future\\nyears to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\\nrespective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The\\nmeasurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which\\nfuture realization is uncertain. The Company accounts for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a\\ncurrent period expense. The Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the\\nprovision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position\\nwill be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\\nbenefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that\\nhas a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties\\nrelated to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial\\nstatements for further information regarding income taxes. Foreign Currency The functional currency for the Company's\\nsubsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company\\ntranslates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using\\nexchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using\\nrates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in\\ncumulative translation adjustment included in \\\"Accumulated other comprehensive income\\\" in Stockholders\\u2019 equity on the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the\\nfunctional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements\\nare recognized in \\\"Interest and other income (expense)\\\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange\\ngains (losses) were $( 18 ) million, $( 293 ) million, and $ 282 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023,\\nand 2022, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes\\ndenominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than\\nfunctional currencies. Foreign exchange gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2024 were net of hedging impacts.\\nNo hedging gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December 31,\\n2023 and 2022. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information. Derivative\\nFinancial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage\\nforeign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing earnings and\\ncash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company recognizes derivative\\ninstruments at fair value as either assets (presented in \\u201cOther current assets\\u201d and \\u201cOther non-current assets\\u201d) or\\nliabilities (presented in \\u201cAccrued expenses and other liabilities\\u201d and \\u201cOther non-current liabilities\\u201d) on the Company\\u2019s\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value\\nhierarchy. Cash flow hedges 44 Table of Contents The Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign\\nexchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, as well as the\\nforeign exchange risk on forecasted transactions and firm commitments related to the licensing and production of foreign\\ncurrency-denominated content assets. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm\\ncommitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may\\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not\\nto hedge certain exposures. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted\\nforeign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\\u201cAOCI\\u201d) and\\nreclassified into \\u201cRevenues\\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction\\naffects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or\\nforecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component\\nof AOCI and reclassified into \\u201cCost of Revenues\\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the\\nhedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from\\nhedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within\\n\\\"Net cash provided by operating activities\\\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the event that the\\nlikelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains\\nor losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to \\u201cInterest and other income (expense)\\u201d in the\\nConsolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation. Fair value hedges The Company designates forward\\ncontracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These\\nhedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may\\nchoose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value\\nhedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in \\u201cInterest and other income (expense),\\u201d net\\nwith the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward\\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the\\nlife of the hedging instrument in \\u201cInterest and other income (expense)\\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nThe difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is\\nrecognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash\\nflows for the underlying item being hedged within \\\"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\\\" on the\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net investment hedges The Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-\\ndenominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign\\nsubsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements,\\nand the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are\\nreported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company\\u2019s Consolidated Balance\\nSheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which\\npoint the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedging\\ninstruments The Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions\\nand monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its\\nsubsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely\\neliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not\\ndesignated as hedging instruments are recorded in \\u201cInterest and other income (expense)\\u201d in the Consolidated Statements\\nof Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \\\"Net cash provided by operating\\nactivities\\\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging\\nActivities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company\\u2019s derivative and non-\\nderivative financial instruments. Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants non-qualified stock options to its\\nemployees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units (\\\"RSUs\\\") and\\nperformance-based restricted stock units (\\\"PSUs\\\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the\\nstock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9\\nStockholders' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based\\ncompensation. 2. Revenue Recognition The following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions\\n(losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nHedging gains of $ 124 million are included in \\u201cStreaming revenues\\u201d for the 45 Table of Contents year ended December 31,\\n2024.

Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not\\nincluded in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the\\neffective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership\\nperiod. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships\\nare assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company\\u2019s\\ninternal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. 46 Table of Contents Deferred revenue\\nprimarily consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid\\nmemberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2024, total deferred revenue was $ 1,521 million, the\\nvast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the\\nnext month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will\\nbe recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12\\nmonths. The $ 78 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $ 1,443 million for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships and price\\nincreases. 3. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding\\nshares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of\\noutstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential outstanding shares of common stock during the period.\\nPotential outstanding shares of common stock are calculated using the treasury-stock method and consist of incremental\\nshares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of time-based and performance-based restricted\\nstock units.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one\\nor more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the\\nlease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included\\nin \\\"Other non-current assets\\\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company\\u2019s right to use the\\nunderlying asset for the lease term. The Company\\u2019s obligations to make lease payments are included in \\\"Accrued expenses\\nand other liabilities\\\" and \\\"Other non-current liabilities\\\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease\\nright-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments\\nover the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve\\nmonths or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense\\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily\\ndeterminable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The\\nCompany has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to\\ntreat as a single lease component.

The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole\\nor in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable\\npremium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company's ability to create, incur or\\nallow certain liens, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the\\nCompany's and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. Certain of the Notes additionally limit the ability to enter\\ninto sale and lease-back transactions and create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the\\nCompany's subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related\\ncovenants. Revolving Credit Facility 52 Table of Contents On April 12, 2024, the Company entered into a five-year , $ 3\\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on April 12, 2029 (the \\u201cRevolving Credit Agreement\\u201d), to\\nreplace its previous $ 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, no amounts have been\\nborrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the\\nCompany\\u2019s option, of either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to a base rate (the \\u201cAlternate Base Rate\\u201d) plus an\\napplicable margin or (ii) a per annum rate equal to an adjusted term SOFR rate (the \\u201cAdjusted Term SOFR Rate\\u201d) plus an\\napplicable margin. The applicable margin for Alternate Base Rate loans will range from 0.00 % to 0.25 %, and the\\napplicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate loans will range from 0.75 % to 1.25 %, each based on the Company\\u2019s credit\\nratings. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants (and customary\\nbaskets and exceptions with respect thereto) for a credit facility of this size and type and requires the Company to\\nmaintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of\\neach fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related\\ncovenants and ratios. 7. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative and non-\\nderivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary\\nobjective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The\\nCompany did not use any derivative instruments prior to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Notional Amount of\\nDerivative Contracts The net notional amounts of the Company\\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments were as follows: As of\\nDecember 31, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Cash\\nflow hedges $ 18,508,390 $ 8,783,273 Fair value hedges 3,819,817 \\u2014 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts 1,432,136 \\u2014 Total $ 23,760,343 $ 8,783,273 As of December 31, 2024, approximately $ 1.0\\nbillion of the Company\\u2019s euro\\u2013denominated Senior Notes was designated as a hedge of the foreign exchange risk of the\\nCompany\\u2019s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. No amounts were designated as net investment hedges as of\\nDecember 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company's euro-denominated Senior Notes (included\\nin \\\"Long-term debt\\\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets) which were designated as the hedged items in fair\\nvalue hedges was approximately $ 3.6 billion. No amounts were designated as fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023.\\nSee Note 6 Debt for further information on the Company\\u2019s debt obligations. Fair Value of Derivative Contracts The fair\\nvalue of the Company\\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments was as follows: 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2024\\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Other current assets Other non-current assets Accrued expenses and other\\nliabilities Other non-current liabilities (in thousands) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange\\ncontracts $ 580,065 $ 406,677 $ 303,425 $ 83 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange\\ncontracts 16,211 \\u2014 14,492 \\u2014 Total $ 596,276 $ 406,677 $ 317,917 $ 83 As of December 31, 2023 Derivative Assets\\nDerivative Liabilities Other current assets Other non-current assets Accrued expenses and other liabilities Other non-\\ncurrent liabilities (in thousands) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts $ 26,416 $\\n4,518 $ 140,089 $ 46,575 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 Total $\\n26,416 $ 4,518 $ 140,089 $ 46,575 The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair\\nvalue hierarchy. These instruments are valued using industry standard valuation models that use observable inputs such\\nas interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices for currencies. As of December 31, 2024, the pre-tax net\\naccumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges included in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets expected\\nto be recognized in earnings within the next 12 months is $ 564 million. Master Netting Agreements In order to mitigate\\ncounterparty credit risk, the Company enters into master netting agreements with its counterparties for its foreign\\ncurrency exchange contracts which permit the parties to settle amounts on a net basis under certain conditions. The\\nCompany has elected to present its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on its Consolidated Balance\\nSheets. The Company also enters into collateral security arrangements with its counterparties that require the parties\\nto post cash collateral when certain contractual thresholds are met. Cash collateral received is presented in \\u201cAccrued\\nexpenses and other liabilities\\u201d representing the Company\\u2019s obligation to return counterparty cash collateral. Cash\\ncollateral posted is presented in \\u201cOther current assets\\u201d representing the Company\\u2019s right to reclaim the cash\\ncollateral. The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash\\ncollateral posted or received. The potential offsetting effect to the Company\\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities under\\nits master netting agreements and collateral security agreements were as follows: As of December 31, 2024 Gross Amount\\nNot Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Gross Amount Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Gross Amount\\nOffset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Net Amount Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Financial Instruments\\nCollateral Received and Posted Net Amount (in thousands) Derivative assets $ 1,002,953 $ \\u2014 $ 1,002,953 $ ( 316,320 ) $ (\\n1,800 ) $ 684,833 Derivative liabilities 318,000 \\u2014 318,000 ( 316,320 ) \\u2014 $ 1,680 54 Table of Contents As of December 31,\\n2023 Gross Amount Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Gross Amount Recognized in the Consolidated Balance\\nSheets Gross Amount Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Net Amount Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\\nFinancial Instruments Collateral Received and Posted Net Amount (in thousands) Derivative assets $ 30,934 $ \\u2014 $ 30,934 $\\n( 27,246 ) $ \\u2014 $ 3,688 Derivative liabilities 186,664 \\u2014 186,664 ( 27,246 ) \\u2014 159,418 Effect of Derivative and Non-\\nDerivative Instruments on Consolidated Financial Statements The pre-tax gains (losses) on the Company\\u2019s cash flow\\nhedges, fair value hedges, and net investment hedges recognized in AOCI were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2024\\n2023 2022 (in thousands) Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts Amount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n$ 1,195,738 $ ( 155,730 ) $ \\u2014 Fair value hedges: Foreign exchange contracts Amount excluded from the assessment of\\neffectiveness ( 14,334 ) \\u2014 \\u2014 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency-denominated debt Amount included in the assessment\\nof effectiveness 32,400 \\u2014 \\u2014 Total $ 1,213,804 $ ( 155,730 ) $ \\u2014 The gains (losses) on hedged items and derivative\\ninstruments recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2024\\nRevenues Cost of Revenues Interest and other income (expense) (in thousands) Total amounts presented in the Consolidated\\nStatements of Operations $ 39,000,966 $ 21,038,464 $ 266,776 Gains on derivatives in cash flow hedging relationship\\nForeign exchange contracts Amount of gains reclassified from AOCI 124,010 1,629 \\u2014 Gains (losses) on derivatives in fair\\nvalue hedging relationship Foreign exchange contracts Hedged items \\u2014 \\u2014 196,660 Derivatives designated as hedging\\ninstruments \\u2014 \\u2014 ( 201,239 ) Amount excluded from assessment of effectiveness and recognized in earnings based on\\namortization approach \\u2014 \\u2014 ( 23,567 ) Gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Foreign exchange\\ncontracts \\u2014 \\u2014 63,291 55 Table of Contents No gains or losses on derivative instruments were reclassified from AOCI into\\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 8. Commitments and\\nContingencies Content At December 31, 2024, the Company had $ 23.2 billion of obligations comprised of $ 4.4 billion\\nincluded in \\\"Current content liabilities\\\" and $ 1.8 billion of \\\"Non-current content liabilities\\\" on the Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets and $ 17.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did\\nnot yet meet the criteria for recognition. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 21.7 billion of obligations comprised\\nof $ 4.5 billion included in \\\"Current content liabilities\\\" and $ 2.6 billion of \\\"Non-current content liabilities\\\" on the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and $ 14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\\nas they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition. The expected timing of payments for these content obligations is\\nas follows: As of December 31, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Less than one year $ 11,424,696 $ 10,328,923 Due after one year\\nand through three years 8,113,910 8,784,302 Due after three years and through five years 2,809,834 2,016,358 Due after\\nfive years 900,491 583,766 Total content obligations $ 23,248,931 $ 21,713,349 Content obligations include amounts\\nrelated to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are\\ntranslated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable\\ncommitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An\\nobligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to\\nobtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance\\nSheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity\\nand/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV\\nseries license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements.\\nThe Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However,\\nthe unknown obligations are expected to be significant. Legal Proceedings From time to time, in the normal course of its\\noperations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations,\\nbusiness practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations.\\nMoreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may\\nchange in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.\\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and\\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have\\nan adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company\\nis involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually\\nor in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the\\nlitigation and events related thereto unfold. Non-Income Taxes The Company is routinely under audit by various tax\\nauthorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from\\ndisputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes\\nthat may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable\\nand reasonably estimable. Similar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number\\nof matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has\\nmeritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and\\nthe final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the\\nvarious issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $\\n400 million, which is expected to increase over time. 56 Table of Contents Guarantees\\u2014Indemnification Obligations In the\\nordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide\\nindemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters,\\nincluding, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company\\u2019s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual\\nproperty infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other\\nparty making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. The Company\\u2019s obligations under\\nthese agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations\\nvary. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or\\nsimilar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company\\u2019s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances\\ninvolved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements\\nwith respect to these indemnification guarantees. 57 Table of Contents 9.

In evaluating its ability to\\nrealize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its\\npast operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent\\nand feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2024, the valuation allowance of $ 540 million was primarily\\nrelated to California R&D tax credits, state net operating loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits that the Company\\ndoes not expect to realize. At December 31, 2024, we have not provided for applicable U.S. income and foreign\\nwithholding taxes on an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest. For\\nthe balance of undistributed earnings for which we are not indefinitely reinvested, we have provided the appropriate\\ntaxes. The unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are\\nclassified as \\u201cOther non-current liabilities\\u201d and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as \\\"Other non-\\ncurrent assets\\\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits was $ 432 million and $ 327 million, respectively, of 62 Table of Contents which $ 251 million\\nand $ 188 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company\\u2019s effective tax rate. The aggregate\\nchanges in the Company\\u2019s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows: As of December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022 (in thousands) Balance at the beginning of the year $ 327,105 $ 226,977 $ 202,557 Increases related to\\ntax positions taken during the current period 93,325 65,630 26,865 Increases related to tax positions taken during prior\\nperiods 15,751 76,794 \\u2014 Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods ( 3,901 ) ( 10,117 ) ( 2,445 )\\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities \\u2014 ( 32,179 ) \\u2014 Decreases related to expiration of statute of\\nlimitations \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 Balance at the end of the year $ 432,280 $ 327,105 $ 226,977 The Company includes interest and\\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in \\u201cOther non-current\\nliabilities\\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company\\nrecorded $ 16 million, $ 25 million, and $ 2 million, respectively, net of interest and penalties in the provision for\\nincome taxes. The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 44 million and $ 28\\nmillion, respectively. The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under\\nexamination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2023. The Company is\\nalso generally subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions for years 2017 through 2023. While the\\nCompany is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and believes that its tax\\npositions will more likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these\\nmatters could arise. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may\\nultimately result from an examination. Given the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible\\nthat the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an\\nestimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time. 11. Employee Benefit Plan The\\nCompany maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute\\nup to 80 % of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company\\u2019s matching contributions totaled $ 128 million, $ 114 million and $ 102\\nmillion, respectively. Multiemployer Benefit Plans The Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension\\nplans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of\\nparticipating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made\\nby the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating\\nemployers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to\\npay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if a company stops contributing to the\\nmultiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining\\nparticipating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health\\nand welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer\\nbenefit plans that are individually significant to the Company. The following table summarizes the Company's\\ncontributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,\\nrespectively: 63 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (in thousands) Pension benefits $ 89,707 $\\n57,285 $ 127,885 Health benefits 134,079 85,157 96,285 Total contributions $ 223,786 $ 142,442 $ 224,170 12. Segment and\\nGeographic Information The Company operates as one operating segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker\\n(\\\"CODM\\\") is its co-chief executive officers, who review financial information presented on a consolidated basis. The\\nCODM uses consolidated operating margin and net income to assess financial performance and allocate resources. These\\nfinancial metrics are used by the CODM to make key operating decisions, such as the determination of the rate at which\\nthe Company seeks to grow global operating margin and the allocation of budget between cost of revenues, sales and\\nmarketing, technology and development, and general and administrative expenses.

Statement of\\nIntent The Company opposes the misuse of material nonpublic information in the trading of securities and it is the\\nintent of this Policy to implement procedures designed to prevent trading based on material nonpublic information\\nregarding the Company, including any of its subsidiaries. The Company also wishes to discourage certain trading in its\\nsecurities by its executive officers, directors, employees and other related individuals that may be contrary to the\\ninterests of our shareholders. The term \\\"executive officer\\\" herein shall have the same meaning as the term \\u201cofficer\\u201d as\\ndefined under Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\u201cExchange Act\\u201d). It is also Company\\npolicy to comply with applicable securities laws concerning trading in Company securities on the Company\\u2019s behalf.\\nDefinition of Material Nonpublic Information It is not possible to define all categories of material information.\\nHowever, information should be regarded as material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would be considered\\nimportant to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision regarding transactions of the Company\\u2019s securities.\\nPut another way, there must be a substantial likelihood that the information would be viewed by the reasonable investor\\nas having significantly altered the total mix of information available in the market concerning the Company. Either\\npositive or negative information may be material. Questions concerning whether nonpublic information is material can be\\ndirected to the Compliance Officer. Covered Parties The Policy covers executive officers, directors and all employees\\nof, or consultants or contractors to, the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as their immediate family members who\\nreside with them, anyone else who lives in their household, and any other individuals who do not live in their household\\nbut whose transactions in Company securities are directed by them or are subject to their influence or control (such as\\nparents or children who consult with them before trading in Company securities) (\\u201cInsiders\\u201d). This Policy applies to\\ntrades of Company securities in which an Insider has any \\u201cbeneficial\\u201d or other interest, or over which they exercise\\ninvestment control. Covered Transactions This Policy applies to all transactions in the Company\\u2019s securities, including\\ncommon stock, options for common stock and any other securities the Company may issue from time to time, such as\\npreferred stock, warrants and convertible debentures, as well as to derivative securities relating to the Company\\u2019s\\nsecurities, whether or not issued by the Company, such as publicly-traded options. Transactions subject to this Policy\\ninclude purchases, sales and bona fide gifts of the Company\\u2019s securities (which may include gifts to trusts for estate\\nplanning purposes, as well as donations to a charitable organization). - 1 - Prohibited Transactions No Insider shall\\nengage in any transaction involving the Company\\u2019s securities, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, during\\nany period commencing with the date that the Insider possesses material nonpublic information concerning the Company or\\nits subsidiaries, and ending at the beginning of the trading day following the date of public disclosure of that\\ninformation, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material. No Insider shall disclose (\\u201ctip\\u201d)\\nmaterial nonpublic information about the Company or its subsidiaries to any other person where such information may be\\nused by such person to their profit by trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates, nor\\nshall such Insider or related person make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of material nonpublic\\ninformation as to trading in the Company\\u2019s securities. No Insider shall engage in any transaction involving another\\ncompany\\u2019s securities while in possession of material nonpublic information about such company when that information is\\nobtained in the course of employment with, or the performance of services on behalf of, the Company and the other\\ncompany is a business partner of the Company such as one with which the Company is discussing a proposed transaction,\\ncollaborator, customer, distributor, vendor or supplier. Except for participation in the Company\\u2019s stock option program,\\nno executive officer or director shall, at any time, engage in any transactions involving any hedging or derivatives of\\nCompany securities, including trading in futures and derivative securities and engaging in hedging activities relating\\nto our securities, including exchange traded options, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps,\\nexchange funds or other arrangements or instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of our\\nsecurities, provided that it shall not be a violation of this Policy for an executive officer or director to engage in\\nany such transaction initiated prior to March 4, 2020. Except as may otherwise be authorized under this Policy,\\nexecutive officers and directors shall not initiate any transactions subsequent to March 4, 2020 that involve pledging\\nany Company securities as collateral for a loan or holding them as security in a margin account. Problematic\\nTransactions While employees (other than executive officers, except as otherwise provided) are not prohibited by this\\nPolicy from using Company securities as collateral for loans or in margin accounts with respect to the Company\\u2019s\\nsecurities or engaging in transactions involving hedging or derivatives of Company securities, including by means of\\nexchange traded options, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds or other\\narrangements or instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of our securities, the Company\\ndiscourages employees from such activity because, among other problems, these types of transactions may result in\\ntransactions in Company securities occurring outside the Open Window (defined below). Limit orders with brokers should\\nnot extend beyond any Open Window and be cancellable upon an imposition of a black-out period. Employees interested in\\ntrading outside of the Open Window should look into adopting a 10b5-1 trading plan, as described below. Exercising stock\\noptions issued pursuant to the Company\\u2019s stock option plan, as otherwise permitted under this Policy, is not considered\\nproblematic. The Company\\u2019s Trading Window The Company has determined that all executive officers, directors, and those\\nother persons identified on Attachment 1 (as may be amended from time to time by the Compliance Officer), shall be\\nprohibited from buying, selling or otherwise effecting transactions in any stock or other securities of the Company or\\nderivative securities thereof EXCEPT during the following trading window: - 2 - Beginning at the open of market on the\\ntrading day following the date of public disclosure of the Company\\u2019s financial results for a preceding calendar quarter\\nor year and ending at the close of market on the 10 th day of the second calendar month of the current calendar quarter\\n(the \\u201cOpen Window\\u201d). In addition, the Company, through the Compliance Officer, may authorize longer or additional\\ntrading windows in which buying, selling, gifting or otherwise effecting transactions in the Company\\u2019s securities would\\nbe permitted pursuant to this Policy as if it were the \\u201cOpen Window.\\u201d Similarly, the Company, through the Compliance\\nOfficer, may impose special black-out periods during which certain persons will be prohibited from buying, selling or\\notherwise effecting transactions in the Company\\u2019s securities, even though the trading window would otherwise be open. If\\na special black-out period is imposed, the Company will notify affected individuals, who should thereafter not engage in\\nany transaction involving the Company\\u2019s securities and should not disclose to others the fact of such suspension of\\ntrading. It should be noted that even during the Open Window, any person possessing material nonpublic information\\nshould not engage in any transactions in the Company\\u2019s securities until the beginning of the trading day following the\\ndate of public disclosure of such information, whether or not the Company has recommended a suspension of trading to\\nthat person. Pre-Clearance of Trades and Other Transactions All executive officers and directors of the Company and\\nother persons designated by the Compliance Officer as being subject to pre-clearance requirements must refrain from\\ntrading in or gifting the Company\\u2019s securities, even during the Open Window, without first contacting the Company\\u2019s\\nCompliance Officer and obtaining pre-clearance to commence trading in the Company\\u2019s securities. In addition, all\\nexecutive officers and directors are required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules and\\nregulations, which set forth reporting obligations as well as limitations on \\u201cshort swing\\u201d transactions. The Company is\\navailable to assist in filing Section 16 reporting; however, the obligation to comply with Section 16 is personal.\\nPlease direct any inquiries concerning compliance to the Compliance Officer. Executive officers and directors who wish\\nto pledge the Company's stock as collateral after March 4, 2020 must first contact the Company's Compliance Officer to\\nrequest an exemption and pre-clearance to enter into the transaction. Adoption and Effect of 10b5-1 Trading Plans The\\nCompany permits all directors, executive officers and employees to adopt trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)\\nunder the Exchange Act (\\u201c10b5-1 trading plans\\u201d). A 10b5-1 trading plan must comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1\\nand may only be adopted or amended in an Open Window and when the person adopting the plan is not otherwise in\\npossession of material nonpublic information about the Company, its subsidiaries or its securities. All 10b5-1 trading\\nplans must be pre-approved by the Compliance Officer or his delegate. The restrictions on trading set forth in this\\nPolicy shall not apply to trades made pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan. More information concerning trading plans is\\navailable from the Compliance Officer. Exemptions from this Policy The exercise of stock options under the Company\\u2019s\\nstock option plan with a cash payment of the exercise price is exempt from this Policy, since the other party to these\\ntransactions is the Company itself and the price does not vary with the market, but is fixed by the terms of the option\\nagreement, or the Company withholding a portion of the shares underlying the options to satisfy exercise price or tax\\nwithholding requirements. This exemption does not - 3 - apply to the sale of any shares issued upon such exercise and it\\ndoes not apply to a cashless exercise of options, which is accomplished by a sale of a portion of the shares issued upon\\nexercise of an option. Post-Termination Transactions If a person is in possession of material nonpublic information when\\ntheir service terminates, that individual should not trade in Company securities until that information has become\\npublic or is no longer material. Consequences for Violation Directors and employees who violate this Policy shall also\\nbe subject to disciplinary action by the Company, which may include ineligibility for future participation in the\\nCompany\\u2019s equity stock option and other incentive plans or termination of employment or service. Pursuant to U.S.\\nfederal and state securities laws, Insiders may be subject to criminal and civil fines and penalties as well as\\nimprisonment for engaging in transactions in the Company\\u2019s securities at a time when they are in possession of material\\nnonpublic information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries. In addition, Insiders may be liable for improper\\ntransactions by any person (commonly referred to as a \\u201ctippee\\u201d) to whom they have disclosed material nonpublic\\ninformation regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions on\\nthe basis of such information as to trading in the Company\\u2019s securities. Individual Responsibility Every executive\\nofficer, director and employee, consultant and contractor has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy,\\nand the applicable laws of their jurisdiction. An Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction\\nin the Company\\u2019s securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the material nonpublic\\ninformation and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by\\nwaiting. Trading in the Company\\u2019s securities during the trading window (including with pre-clearance) should not be\\nconsidered a \\u201csafe harbor,\\u201d and all directors, executive officers and other persons should use good judgment at all\\ntimes. Compliance Officer \\u25cf The Company\\u2019s Chief Legal Officer shall serve as the Insider Trading Compliance Officer (the\\n\\u201cCompliance Officer\\u201d). The duties of the Compliance Officer shall include, but not be limited to, the following: \\u25cf Pre-\\nclearing transactions as required under this Policy. \\u25cf Assisting, as requested, in the preparation and filing of Section\\n16 reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5) for Section 16 reporting persons. \\u25cf Serving as the designated recipient at the Company of\\ncopies of reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Section 16 reporting persons under Section 16 of\\nthe Exchange Act. \\u25cf Circulating the Policy (and/or a summary thereof) to all employees, including Section 16 reporting\\npersons, on an annual basis. \\u25cf Assisting the Company in implementation of the Policy. \\u25cf Coordinating with Company\\ncounsel regarding compliance activities with respect to Rule 144 requirements and regarding changing requirements and\\nrecommendations for compliance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act and insider trading laws to ensure that the Policy is\\namended as necessary to comply with such requirements. - 4 - The duties may be delegated by the Compliance Officer to\\nsuch other individuals as the Compliance Officer deems appropriate. * * * * * Attachment 1 Persons subject to trading\\nwindow restrictions Insiders, as defined in the Company\\u2019s Insider Trading Policy, except for the following: \\u25cf Employees,\\ncontractors and consultants who are employed or retained through a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company that is\\nspecifically and solely engaged in the production of original content and not otherwise included as a matter of business\\npractice in the distribution of corporate information about the Company and its financial performance, unless such\\nperson has been notified in writing by the Compliance Officer that the trading window applies to them. \\u25cf Employees of\\nsubsidiaries that are not integrated into the Company's email systems and/or who do not have access to consolidated\\nfinancial data. - 5 - EX-21.1 3 ex211-q424.htm EX-21.1 Document EXHIBIT 21.1 NETFLIX, INC.

     \"Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries\\nof new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under\\nAccounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\\u201cASC 606\\u201d), including access to our FSD\\n(Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air\\nsoftware updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a\\nvehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We\\nalso recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market\\nvalues, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to\\nour internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control\\ntransfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver\\nsuch services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or\\nexpiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance\\nperiod, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is\\nrecognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For\\nour obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop\\nand deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. Inventory\\nValuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for\\nvehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-\\ndowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our\\ninventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our\\ninventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the\\ninventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert\\nthe inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that\\ninventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase\\nin that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change,\\nadditional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a\\nmaterial charge to our reported financial results. 35 Warranties We provide a manufacturer\\u2019s warranty on all new and\\nused vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for\\nperiods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These\\nestimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future\\nclaims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may\\ncause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty\\ncosts associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease\\ncontracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty\\nreserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the\\nremaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities\\nthat we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually\\nobligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the\\ncurrent portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component\\nof Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our\\naccrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value\\nmethod of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (\\u201cRSUs\\u201d) granted to employees and for our employee\\nstock purchase plan (the \\u201cESPP\\u201d) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based\\nawards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant\\nor offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs\\nsuch as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally\\nrequire significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market\\nvalue of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to\\nprovide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options\\nand RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of\\nactual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the\\nexpected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual\\nperformance milestone becomes probable. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we\\nincorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected\\nlives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense\\nthat we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income\\nTaxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\\ndetermining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded\\nagainst our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of\\nour deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment\\nof realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss)\\nadjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax\\nbenefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing\\ntemporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\\u2019s projected future results of business operations,\\nincluding uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our\\ncommon stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future\\ntaxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our\\nvaluation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. 36\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there\\nare many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the\\neffect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These\\neffects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\\nmore likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the\\napplicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various\\nfederal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our\\nconsideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience\\nand interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as\\nthe closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final\\ntax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period\\nin which such determination is made.

These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Automotive regulatory credits includes\\nsales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is\\ndirectly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them\\nproactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as\\npossible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits. Automotive\\nleasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally,\\nautomotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with\\nthe sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-\\nwarranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail\\nmerchandise sales. 2024 compared to 2023 Automotive sales revenue decreased $6.03 billion, or 8%, in the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower average selling price on our\\nvehicles driven by overall price reductions and attractive financing options provided in 2024 as well as mix.\\nAdditionally, there was a decrease of approximately 22,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. The decreases\\nwere partially offset by an increase of approximately 19,000 deliveries of other models primarily due to our production\\nramp of Cybertruck. Additionally, we recognized $596 million of FSD (Supervised) revenue due to release of certain\\nfeatures in 2024. 37 Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $973 million, or 54%, in the year ended December\\n31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by demand for credits in North America as other\\nautomobile manufacturers scale back on their battery electric vehicle plans. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $293\\nmillion, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to\\nlower direct sales-type leasing deliveries as we have shifted towards providing leasing options through commercial\\nbanking partner programs that allow for us to recognize upfront revenue in automotive sales and a decrease in lease\\nbuyouts. Services and other revenue increased $2.22 billion, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to\\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance\\nservices and collision revenue, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and part sales revenue. Energy\\nGeneration and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy\\ngeneration and energy storage products, financing of solar energy generation products, services related to such products\\nand sales of solar energy systems incentives. 2024 compared to 2023 Energy generation and storage revenue increased\\n$4.05 billion, or 67%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily\\ndue to a 16.7 GWh increase in Megapack and Powerwall deployments compared to the prior year.

Cost of automotive sales\\nrevenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory\\nwhen it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of\\nforecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. Cost of\\nautomotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with\\ndirect sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Costs of services and other revenue includes\\ncost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services,\\ncosts associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and\\ncosts of retail merchandise sales. 2024 compared to 2023 Cost of automotive sales revenue decreased $3.25 billion, or\\n5%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in the average\\ncombined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily from lower raw material costs, freight and duties as well as mix, in\\naddition to the volume changes in deliveries year over year as discussed above. The decreases were partially offset by\\nhigher costs for Cybertruck. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $265 million, or 21%, in the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type\\nleasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries and a decrease in our direct operating lease cost of revenue driven\\nby lower lease buyouts compared to the prior periods. Cost of services and other revenue increased $2.09 billion, or\\n27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to volume\\nincreases in used vehicle sales at lower average vehicle acquisition cost, insurance services, paid Supercharging, part\\nsales and non-warranty maintenance services and collision. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 19.4% to\\n18.4% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to lower average selling\\nprice on our vehicles and Cybertruck ramp, partially offset by lower average combined cost per unit of our vehicles and\\nincreases in regulatory credit and FSD (Supervised) revenue, as discussed above. Gross margin for total automotive &\\nservices and other segment decreased from 18.2% to 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2023. The changes in gross margin are primarily due to the automotive gross margin factors discussed\\nabove. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect\\nmaterial and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight,\\nwarranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write\\ndown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete\\nand on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue\\nbenefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the\\ncost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs\\nassociated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 2024 compared to 2023 Cost of energy\\ngeneration and storage revenue increased $2.55 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the\\nyear ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in Megapack and Powerwall deployments, partially offset by\\nincreases in IRA manufacturing credits recognized as compared to the prior year. 39 Gross margin for energy generation\\nand storage increased from 18.9% to 26.2% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31,\\n2023, primarily due to margin improvements for our energy storage products driven by cost reductions, including benefits\\nfrom IRA manufacturing credits, and a higher proportion of our storage business, which operated at a higher gross\\nmargin, within the segment as compared to the prior periods.

R&D expenses increased $571 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023. The overall increases were primarily driven by additional costs year over year related to AI\\nprograms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 4% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as\\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2023 as we continue to expand our product roadmap and technologies.

As a result, we recognized\\n$583 million of employee termination expenses in Restructuring and other in our consolidated income statement. These\\nexpenses were substantially paid with an immaterial accrual remaining in Accrued liabilities and other in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.

See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Other income (expense), net, changed favorably by $523\\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to\\nremeasurement of our bitcoin digital assets to fair value in 2024 (see above), partially offset by unfavorable\\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our intercompany balances. As our intercompany balances are\\nsignificant in nature and we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk, we can experience significant fluctuations in\\nforeign currency exchange rate gains and losses from period to period. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Year\\nEnded December 31, 2024 vs. 2023 Change 2023 vs. 2022 Change (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 $ % $ % Provision for\\n(benefit from) income taxes $ 1,837 $ (5,001) $ 1,132 $ 6,838 Not meaningful $ (6,133) Not meaningful Effective tax rate\\n20 % (50) % 8 % Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes changed by $6.84 billion in the year ended December 31,\\n2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Our effective tax rate changed to an expense of 20% in the year\\nended December 31, 2024 from a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023. These changes are primarily due to\\nthe impact of releasing the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023. We\\nmonitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of\\nour taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable\\nearnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax\\nassets are realizable and released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, we continue to\\nconclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are realizable, except for our California deferred\\ntax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. See Note 13, Income Taxes , to the\\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Liquidity\\nand Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our\\ncore operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new\\nproducts and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing\\nmanufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service\\nlocations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation\\ncapabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products. In addition, because a large portion of\\nour future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and\\noperating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or\\nramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to\\ncorrespondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may\\ndecide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our\\nbusiness, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also\\nfrom time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. 41\\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month\\nperiod following December 31, 2024, as well as in the long-term. See the sections below for more details regarding the\\nmaterial requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash\\nRequirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the\\npurchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual\\nterms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to\\nrenegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the\\nshort-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As\\ndiscussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\\u2014Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025\\nOutlook\\u2014Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital\\nexpenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $11.00 billion in 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal\\nyears. As of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of\\nindebtedness, of which $2.35 billion is current. As of December 31, 2024, our total minimum lease payments was $7.05\\nbillion, of which $1.19 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease\\nobligations, refer to Note 10, Debt , and Note 11, Leases , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere\\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash\\nrequirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of\\nour energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity offerings, when applicable.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $16.14 billion and $20.42 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term\\ninvestments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.90 billion and\\nconsisted primarily of euros and Chinese yuan. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of December\\n31, 2024. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 10, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements\\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk\\nobjectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments, invest in autonomy, do more vertical\\nintegration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended\\nDecember 31, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,923 $ 13,256 $ 14,724\\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (18,787) $ (15,584) $ (11,973) Net cash provided by (used in) financing\\nactivities $ 3,853 $ 2,589 $ (3,527) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are\\nsignificantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and\\ndevelopment and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from\\nvehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of\\nregulatory credits and energy generation and storage products, and interest income on our cash and investments\\nportfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our\\nmanufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. 42 Net cash\\nprovided by operating activities increased by $1.67 billion to $14.92 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024\\nfrom $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in net\\noperating assets and liabilities of $2.29 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash\\nexpenses, gains and losses of $623 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows from investing\\nactivities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $11.34 billion\\nand $8.90 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly for AI-related capital\\nexpenditures, global factory expansion and machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We also\\npurchased $7.45 billion and $6.62 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities\\nincreased by $1.26 billion to $3.85 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2.59 billion during the year\\nended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.81 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt,\\npartially offset by a $1.15 billion increase in repayments of debt. See Note 10, Debt , to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations.\\nAdditionally, there was an increase of $541 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock\\nissuances compared to the prior year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\\nPolicies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 43 ITEM 7A.\\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in\\nmultiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating\\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our\\ncurrent year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign\\nsubsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do\\nnot typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in\\nour net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities\\ndenominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash\\nequivalents balances). We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is\\nreasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be\\nexperienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\\ncurrencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had\\non our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.15 billion at December\\n31, 2024 and $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023, assuming no foreign currency hedging. 44 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nAND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page Report of Independent Registered Public\\nAccounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 238 ) 46 Consolidated Balance Sheets 48 Consolidated Statements of Operations 49 Consolidated\\nStatements of Comprehensive Income 50 Consolidated Statements of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Equity 51\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 52 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 53 45 Report of Independent\\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc. Opinions on the Financial\\nStatements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of\\nTesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \\\"Company\\\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated\\nstatements of operations, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows\\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to\\nas the \\\"consolidated financial statements\\\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial\\nreporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated\\nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\\nas of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in\\nthe period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\\nAmerica. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\\n(2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial\\nstatements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for digital assets in 2024. Basis for Opinions The\\nCompany's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial\\nreporting, included in Management\\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\nthat we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements\\nare free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included\\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\\noverall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\\nassessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 46 Definition and Limitations of\\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records\\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition\\nof the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent\\nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit\\nMatters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the\\nconsolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that\\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in\\nany way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures\\nto which it relates. Automotive Warranty Reserve As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total\\naccrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $6,716 million as of December 31, 2024. The\\nCompany provides a manufacturer\\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these\\nproducts sold, which includes management\\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under\\nwarranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the\\nnature, frequency and costs of future claims. The principal considerations for our determination that performing\\nprocedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by\\nmanagement in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; (ii) a high degree of\\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\\u2019s significant assumptions\\nrelated to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models; and, (iii) the audit\\neffort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing\\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\\u2019s estimate of the\\nautomotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management\\u2019s significant\\nassumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of\\nactual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy\\nof historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the\\nestimation of future claims and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\\nevaluating the reasonableness of management\\u2019s estimate by (a) developing an independent estimate of the automotive\\nwarranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and (b) comparing the independent estimate to management\\u2019s estimate.\\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of management\\u2019s\\nsignificant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose,\\nCalifornia January 29, 2025 We have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 2005. 47 Tesla, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 \\u2013 Overview\\nTesla, Inc. (\\u201cTesla\\u201d, the \\u201cCompany\\u201d, \\u201cwe\\u201d, \\u201cus\\u201d or \\u201cour\\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003 and\\nconverted to a Texas corporation on June 13, 2024. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance\\nfully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. Note 2 \\u2013\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial\\nstatements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our\\nsubsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810,\\nConsolidation (\\u201cASC 810\\u201d), we consolidate any variable interest entity (\\u201cVIE\\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary.\\nWe have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding\\nand monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing\\nprograms. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting\\ninterests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through\\narrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to\\nconsolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE\\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the\\nVIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not\\nconsolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We\\nhave determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15 , Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\n). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary\\nbeneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of Estimates The\\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the\\naccompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale\\nvalue guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income taxes, the\\ncollectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets,\\ngoodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar\\nenergy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events\\nor circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of\\nour assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as\\nnew events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates\\nunder different assumptions or conditions. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to\\nconform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. 53\\nRevenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions): Year\\nEnded December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Automotive sales $ 72,480 $ 78,509 $ 67,210 Automotive regulatory credits 2,763 1,790\\n1,776 Energy generation and storage sales 9,564 5,515 3,376 Services and other 10,534 8,319 6,091 Total revenues from\\nsales and services 95,341 94,133 78,453 Automotive leasing 1,827 2,120 2,476 Energy generation and storage leasing 522\\n520 533 Total revenues $ 97,690 $ 96,773 $ 81,462 Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Automotive sales revenue includes\\nrevenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet\\nthe definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD(Supervised) features and their\\nongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize\\nrevenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments\\nare typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business,\\nexcept sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales\\nreturn reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale\\nvalue guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity,\\nunlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and\\nrecognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the\\ncustomer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is\\nearlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is\\ngenerally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when\\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations\\nrelated to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. Any fees that are paid or\\npayable by us to a customer\\u2019s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against\\nautomotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our\\ncontract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales\\nrevenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or\\naccessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude\\ntaxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. We offer resale value guarantees to\\nour commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate\\nthe lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking\\npartner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. 54 We receive upfront payment for the\\nvehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if\\nthey are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the\\nlease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other\\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles\\nsold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee\\nliabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change,\\nthere may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under\\nthese programs were immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if\\nthey are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\\u2019s contractual residual value at the end of the lease term\\nwas $ 1.45 billion and $ 166 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deferred revenue related to the\\naccess to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging\\nprograms and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions): Year\\nEnded December 31, 2024 2023 Deferred revenue \\u2014 beginning of period $ 3,536 $ 2,913 Additions 1,343 1,201 Net changes in\\nliability for pre-existing contracts, including foreign exchange impact ( 92 ) 17 Revenue recognized ( 1,188 ) ( 595 )\\nDeferred revenue \\u2014 end of period $ 3,599 $ 3,536 Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated\\nto the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue\\nrecognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 872 million and $ 469 million for\\nthe years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2024,\\nwe expect to recognize $ 840 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the\\ntime of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales. We\\nhave financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive\\ndeliveries. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $ 247 million and $ 242\\nmillion, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $ 821 million and $ 1.04 billion, respectively, in Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our\\nautomotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell\\nthese credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\\nrequirements. Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the\\ncustomer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive\\nregulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory\\ncredits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31,\\n2023 and 2022 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we\\nhad also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration\\nfor credits sold previously. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction\\nprice allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract length of one year\\nor less. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or\\npartially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 4.68 billion. Of this\\namount, we expect to recognize $ 863 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance\\nobligation period. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our\\nremaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts. 55 Automotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs\\nin the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly\\nfrom Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase\\nthe vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record\\nleasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the\\ndepreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and\\n2022, we recognized $ 1.78 billion, $ 1.86 billion and $ 1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively.\\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $ 394 million and $ 458 million, respectively, of lease-related\\nupfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Direct\\nSales-Type Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements\\naccounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases (\\u201cASC 842\\u201d), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our\\narrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with\\nthe sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery\\nof the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive\\nleasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and\\n2022, we recognized $ 12 million, $ 215 million and $ 683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 7\\nmillion, $ 164 million and $ 427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. Services and Other\\nRevenue Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision,\\npart sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. Revenues related to repair,\\nmaintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans\\nare recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation\\nto the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus\\nuse standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in\\ntransactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and\\nmerchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment\\nterms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the\\nrelated contracts and are included within Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in\\nDeferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance\\npremiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding\\nunearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Energy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy\\nsystems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales\\nof solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and\\ninstallation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar\\nenergy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is\\nwhen we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having\\njurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the\\ninstallation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product\\nhas been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage\\nsystems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. 56 For certain large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of\\nthe system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue\\nfrom such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a\\npercentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales. In instances where there are multiple\\nperformance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract\\nbased on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs\\nplus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions\\npaid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy\\nstorage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\\nAs part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant\\nthat the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If\\nan energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated\\ndamages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system\\ncontracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such\\nguarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data\\nbecomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a\\nsignificant reversal of revenue will not occur. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are\\nprimarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations\\nare satisfied. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 1.77\\nbillion and $ 1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred\\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 1.27 billion and $ 571 million for the years ended December 31,\\n2024 and 2023, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction\\nprice allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected\\ncontract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds\\ndirectly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to\\nperformance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of\\nmore than one year was $ 7.18 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 4.51 billion in the next 12 months and\\nthe rest over the remaining performance obligation period. We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance\\nsheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current\\nnet financing receivables of $ 34 million and $ 31 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $ 658 million\\nand $ 578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Energy Generation and Storage\\nLeasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and\\nstorage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned\\nfrom such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition\\ncriteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred\\nrevenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase\\nelectricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted\\nfor as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases . Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered\\nat rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred\\nrevenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized,\\nwhich is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\\ndeferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 164 million and $ 181 million, respectively. Deferred\\nrevenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state\\ngovernment agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred\\nrevenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial. 57 We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of\\nagreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of\\nsolar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements. Cost of\\nRevenues Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials,\\nlabor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs,\\nvehicle connectivity costs, FSD (Supervised) ongoing maintenance costs, electricity costs for our free Supercharging\\nprograms and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to\\nwarranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net\\nrealizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of\\nautomotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $ 625 million and $ 359 million for\\nthe years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes\\nthe depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty\\nexpense related to leased vehicles. Services and Other Costs of services and other revenue includes cost of used\\nvehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs\\nassociated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs\\nof retail merchandise sales. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Cost of energy\\ngeneration and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including\\ndepreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation\\nand storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its\\nestimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\\nAdditionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $\\n756 million and $ 115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar\\nenergy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost\\nof leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct\\ncosts. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes We are\\nsubject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and\\nliability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the\\nfinancial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the\\ndifferences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce\\ndeferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 58 Significant judgment is required in determining our\\nprovision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\\ndeferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax\\nassets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability\\nof our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for\\npermanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to\\nstock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.\\nWe also rely on our assessment of the Company\\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty\\nin future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its\\nperformance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and\\nchanges in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance\\nassessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. We record liabilities\\nrelated to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe\\nthat it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued\\ninterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Tax Cuts and Jobs\\nAct subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\\u201cGILTI\\u201d) earned by certain foreign\\nsubsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as\\na current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method,\\nunder which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nComprehensive Income Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other\\ncomprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on\\ninvestments that have been excluded from the determination of net income. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value\\nmethod of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of\\nemployee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only\\nservice and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and\\nexpected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is\\nmeasured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized\\nover the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting\\nperiod, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation\\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards,\\nstock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. As we accumulate\\nadditional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we\\nmay calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of\\nour stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based\\ncompensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and\\nadministrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 59 Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable\\nNoncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party\\ninterests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs\\nof solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the\\nfunds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating\\nthe noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing\\narrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\\u201cHLBV\\u201d) method. We,\\ntherefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net\\nassets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance\\nsheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the\\nHLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the\\nconsolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet\\ndate under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their\\nrecorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\\ndistributed to the third parties. The third parties\\u2019 interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined\\nas the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions\\nbetween the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to\\nthe redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine\\nsection of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the\\nfunds for cash or other assets. Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net\\nincome per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable\\nto common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive\\nshares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards,\\nwarrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are\\nincluded when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their\\neffect is dilutive. The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to\\nnet income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions): Year Ended December\\n31, 2024 2023 2022 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 7,091 $ 14,997 $ 12,556 Less: Buy-outs of\\nnoncontrolling interests ( 39 ) ( 2 ) ( 27 ) Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock\\n7,130 14,999 12,583 Less: Dilutive convertible debt \\u2014 \\u2014 ( 1 ) Net income used in computing diluted net income per share\\nof common stock $ 7,130 $ 14,999 $ 12,584 60 The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted\\nweighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders (in\\nmillions): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of\\ncommon stock, basic 3,197 3,174 3,130 Add: Stock-based awards 292 298 310 Convertible senior notes 1 2 3 Warrants 8 11\\n32 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted 3,498 3,485 3,475 The\\nfollowing table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income\\nper share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Stock-based awards 15 12 4 Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid\\ninvestments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.\\nRestricted Cash We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised\\nprimarily of cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities, cash held as collateral for\\nsales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted\\ncash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the\\nexpected duration of the restriction. Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the\\nconsolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 December 31,\\n2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,139 $ 16,398 $ 16,253 Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current\\nassets 494 543 294 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 404 248 377 Total as presented in the\\nconsolidated statements of cash flows $ 17,037 $ 17,189 $ 16,924 Investments Our investments are all designated as\\navailable-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss which is included within stockholders\\u2019 equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with\\nmaturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments\\nare included within Interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on our short-term\\ninvestments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $ 763 million, $ 388 million and an immaterial\\namount, respectively. 61 The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method.\\nRealized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net. We\\nregularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the\\nconsideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the\\ncreditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair\\nvalue. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to\\nreceivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers,\\nsales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and\\ngovernment rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the\\namount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed\\nuncollectible. Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable\\nbalance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and\\nreceipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual\\npayment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are\\ndependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances\\nassociated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government\\nrebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific\\njurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from\\nperiod to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $ 315 million and $ 378 million,\\nrespectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $ 207 million,\\nrespectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets. Financing\\nReceivables We provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables\\nare carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in\\namounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit\\nlosses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit\\nlosses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future\\ncash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. When originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract\\nterms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant\\u2019s\\nability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key\\nconsiderations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination. After\\norigination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For\\nall financing receivables, we define \\u201cpast due\\u201d as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31\\ndays past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables\\nwere at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our\\nfinancing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022. We have customer notes\\nreceivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the\\npurchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding\\nbalances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a\\ncomponent of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the\\nlong-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable,\\nnet of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 248 million and $ 266 million, respectively, of which $ 4 million and\\n$ 5 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and\\n2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 33 million and $ 36 million, respectively. 62 Concentration of Risk\\nCredit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash\\nequivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments\\nbalances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-\\ngrade securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no entity\\nrepresented 10% or more of our total receivables balance. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, including\\nsingle source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a\\ntimely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these\\ncomponents from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition\\nand operating results. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is\\ncomputed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out\\nbasis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and\\nfuture demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are\\nwritten-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon\\nthe ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the\\nestimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower\\ncost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the\\nrestoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or\\nproduction costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our\\nestimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Operating Lease Vehicles Vehicles that are\\nleased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of\\nautomotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31,\\n2024 and 2023 was $ 7.03 billion and $ 7.36 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance\\nsheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.45 billion and $ 1.38 billion as of December 31, 2024 and\\n2023, respectively. Digital Assets, Net We account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-\\nlived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-60, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets . We have\\nownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital\\nassets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.\\nPeriods prior to January 1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses incurred since their\\nacquisition. We determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value\\nMeasurement (\\u201cASC 820\\u201d), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal\\nmarket for such assets (Level I inputs). We determine the cost basis of our digital assets using the specific\\nidentification of each unit received. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are now recorded to Other income\\n(expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. 63 For periods prior to January 1, 2024, impairment losses\\nwere recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the\\nimpairment was identified. Also for periods prior to January 1, 2024, gains were not recorded until realized upon\\nsale(s), at which point they were presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within\\nRestructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the\\nsales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale. See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net ,\\nfor further information regarding digital assets. Solar Energy Systems, Net We are the lessor of solar energy systems,\\nwhich are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of solar energy systems is calculated using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 35 years. The gross cost of solar energy systems as of\\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 6.79 billion and $ 6.87 billion, respectively. Solar energy systems on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.86 billion and $ 1.64 billion as of December 31,\\n2024 and 2023, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold\\nimprovements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows: Machinery, equipment,\\nvehicles and office furniture 3 to 15 years Tooling 4 to 7 years Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years\\nComputer equipment and software 3 to 6 years AI infrastructure 5 to 30 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a\\nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. AI infrastructure includes our owned data centers. Upon the\\nretirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed\\nfrom the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of\\noperations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the\\nfunctionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful\\nlife. Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy\\nsystems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\\nthat the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the\\ncarrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not\\nrecoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023\\nand 2022, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets. Intangible assets with definite lives are\\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years . Goodwill\\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit\\u2019s fair value.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did no t recognize any impairment of goodwill. 64\\nCapitalization of Software Costs We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the\\napplication development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to\\npreliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on\\na straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years . Software development costs incurred in\\ndevelopment of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of\\ntechnological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected\\nto become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is\\nmade generally available to our customers. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test\\nfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\\nForeign Currency We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their\\noperating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not\\nthe U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current\\nperiod income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate\\nto its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet. Foreign\\ncurrency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in\\ncurrencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized\\nin Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024,\\n2023 and 2022, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $ 57 million, gain of $ 122 million and loss of $\\n89 million, respectively. Warranties We provide a manufacturer\\u2019s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on\\nthe installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to\\n25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected\\ncosts to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently\\nuncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty\\nreserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles\\nsubject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair\\nthese warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the\\nnext 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other\\nlong-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive\\nindemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is\\nprimarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): Year\\nEnded December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Accrued warranty\\u2014beginning of period $ 5,152 $ 3,505 $ 2,101 Warranty costs incurred (\\n1,453 ) ( 1,225 ) ( 803 ) Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign\\nexchange impact 287 539 522 Provision for warranty 2,730 2,333 1,685 Accrued warranty\\u2014end of period $ 6,716 $ 5,152 $\\n3,505 65 Customer Deposits Customer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time\\nthey place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of\\ndelivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be\\ncancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued\\nliabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer\\u2019s\\npurchase balance. Government Assistance Programs and Incentives Globally, the operation of our business is impacted by\\nvarious government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated\\nfinancial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital\\nasset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to\\nbe met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt. The IRA Incentives On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted\\ninto law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to\\npromote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new\\ncorporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater\\nthan $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our costs of\\nrevenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Gigafactory New York\\u2014New York State Investment and Lease We have a\\nlease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and\\na related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are\\nrequired to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the\\narrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and\\nthe acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or\\nequipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). This incentive reduces the\\nrelated lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line\\nitems in our consolidated statements of operations and was not material for any period presented. Gigafactory\\nShanghai\\u2014Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use\\nrights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital\\nexpenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government\\nhas granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital\\ninvestments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). Incentives that offset costs of\\nour facilities are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and\\nequipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our manufacturing operations are\\nrecorded as an offset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31,\\n2024 and 2023, the amounts received were immaterial. Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of\\nGigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements in 2014 with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide\\nabatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $ 195\\nmillion in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. 66 Gigafactory\\nTexas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement in\\n2020 with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70 - 80 % of property taxes\\npaid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement in 2020 with the Del Valle Independent School District in\\nTexas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each\\ncase subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at\\nGigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive\\nrevenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31,\\n2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial. Defined Contribution Plan We have\\na 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of\\nthe Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating\\nemployees may elect to contribute up to 90 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning\\nin January 2022, we began to match 50 % of each employee\\u2019s contributions up to a maximum of 6 % (capped at $ 3,000 ) of\\nthe employee\\u2019s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023\\nand 2022, we recognized $ 107 million, $ 99 million and $ 91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer\\ncontributions for the 401(k) savings plan. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements\\nnot yet adopted In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update\\n(\\u201cASU\\u201d) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information\\nabout a reporting entity\\u2019s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The\\nASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also\\npermitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will\\nlikely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once\\nadopted. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic\\n220-40). The ASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory,\\nemployee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires\\ndisclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. The ASU is effective\\nfor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December\\n15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for\\nreporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the\\nconsolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in the required\\nadditional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently\\nevaluating the provisions of this ASU. Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU\\nNo. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure\\nrequirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the\\nChief Operating Decision Maker (\\u201cCODM\\u201d) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This\\nASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of\\nhow the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment\\u2019s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how\\nto allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this ASU retrospectively on December 31, 2024. Refer\\nto Note 17, Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas for the inclusion of the new required disclosures.\\n67 ASU 2023-08 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\\n(Subtopic 350-60) (\\u201cnew crypto assets standard\\u201d). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be\\nmeasured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each\\nreporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by\\nrequiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new\\ncrypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods\\nwithin those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the\\nopening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the\\namendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets\\nstandard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning\\nof the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified\\nretrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. Refer to Note 3, Digital Assets, Net for the inclusion of the new\\nrequired disclosures. The cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2024 consolidated balance sheet for\\nthe adoption of the new crypto assets standard was as follows (in millions): Balances at December 31, 2023 Adjustments\\nfrom Adoption of the New Crypto Assets Standard Balances at January 1, 2024 Assets Digital assets, net $ 184 $ 303 $ 487\\nDeferred tax assets 6,733 ( 67 ) 6,666 Stockholders' equity Retained earnings 27,882 236 28,118 Note 3 \\u2013 Digital Assets,\\nNet During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital\\nassets.

These amounts contributed $ 0.08 to both basic and diluted net income attributable\\nto common stockholders per share of common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2024. There were no impairment\\nlosses recorded for any period during the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result, the unaudited interim balances of\\nDigital assets, net did not change throughout the year ended December 31, 2024 prior to the adoption of the new crypto\\nassets standard, which was adopted as of January 1, 2024. Note 4 \\u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill decreased $ 9\\nmillion within the automotive segment from $ 253 million as of December 31, 2023 to $ 244 million as of December 31,\\n2024. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 69 The net carrying value of our\\nintangible assets decreased from $ 178 million as of December 31, 2023 to $ 150 million as of December 31, 2024 mainly\\nfrom amortization. Note 5 \\u2013 Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 states that fair value is an exit price,\\nrepresenting the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\\ntransaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined\\nbased on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value\\nhierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable\\ninputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are\\nobservable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market\\ndata. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our\\nassets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): December 31,\\n2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Certificates of\\ndeposit and time deposits $ 12,767 $ \\u2014 $ 12,767 $ \\u2014 $ 6,996 $ \\u2014 $ 6,996 $ \\u2014 Commercial paper 3,919 \\u2014 3,919 \\u2014 470 \\u2014 470 \\u2014\\nU.S. government securities 3,620 \\u2014 3,620 \\u2014 5,136 \\u2014 5,136 \\u2014 Corporate debt securities 118 \\u2014 118 \\u2014 480 \\u2014 480 \\u2014 Money\\nmarket funds 1,753 1,753 \\u2014 \\u2014 109 109 \\u2014 \\u2014 Digital assets 1,076 1,076 \\u2014 \\u2014 Not applicable Total $ 23,253 $ 2,829 $ 20,424 $\\n\\u2014 $ 13,191 $ 109 $ 13,082 $ \\u2014 All of our money market funds and digital assets are classified within Level I of the fair\\nvalue hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities,\\ncertificates of deposit, commercial paper, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level II of\\nthe fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. Our cash, cash\\nequivalents and investments classified by security type as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in\\nmillions): December 31, 2024 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash\\nEquivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 14,386 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 $ 14,386 $ 14,386 $ \\u2014 Certificates of deposit and time deposits\\n12,767 \\u2014 \\u2014 12,767 \\u2014 12,767 Commercial paper 3,908 11 \\u2014 3,919 \\u2014 3,919 U.S. government securities 3,618 3 ( 1 ) 3,620 \\u2014\\n3,620 Corporate debt securities 117 1 \\u2014 118 \\u2014 118 Money market funds 1,753 \\u2014 \\u2014 1,753 1,753 \\u2014 Total cash, cash\\nequivalents and short-term investments $ 36,549 $ 15 $ ( 1 ) $ 36,563 $ 16,139 $ 20,424 70 December 31, 2023 Adjusted\\nCost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $\\n15,903 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 $ 15,903 $ 15,903 $ \\u2014 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 6,995 1 \\u2014 6,996 \\u2014 6,996 U.S. government\\nsecurities 5,136 1 ( 1 ) 5,136 277 4,859 Corporate debt securities 485 1 ( 6 ) 480 \\u2014 480 Commercial paper 470 \\u2014 \\u2014 470\\n109 361 Money market funds 109 \\u2014 \\u2014 109 109 \\u2014 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 29,098 $ 3 $ ( 7\\n) $ 29,094 $ 16,398 $ 12,696 As of December 31, 2024, the vast majority of our short-term investments had contractual\\nmaturity dates within one year.

Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is\\nrecourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying\\nvalues are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As of December 31, 2024, we were in material compliance\\nwith all financial debt covenants. 2024 Notes During the second quarter of 2024, the 2024 Notes reached maturity and\\nwere fully settled. Additionally, in 2024, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of\\nthe 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 11.4 million shares of our common stock. Credit Agreement In January 2023,\\nwe entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \\u201cRCF Credit Agreement\\u201d) with a syndicate of\\nbanks. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $ 5.00\\nbillion, which could be increased up to $ 7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be\\nused for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-\\ndenominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10 %, or\\n(b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average\\nreference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each\\ncase, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured\\nlong-term indebtedness (the \\u201cCredit Rating\\u201d) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the\\nCredit Rating and is currently 0.125 % per annum. Automotive Asset-backed Notes From time to time, we transfer\\nreceivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose\\nentities (\\u201cSPEs\\u201d) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are\\nconsolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the\\nprincipal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs\\u2019 expenses, and any remaining\\ncash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or\\nfinancing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs\\u2019 assets and cash flows are not available\\nto our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no\\nrecourse to our other assets. In 2024, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and/or\\nfinancing receivables into SPEs and issued $ 2.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed\\nNotes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance,\\nnet of debt issuance costs, were $ 2.44 billion. Energy Asset-backed Notes In 2024, we transferred certain financing\\nreceivables into an SPE and issued $ 499 million in aggregate principal amount of Energy Asset-backed Notes, backed by\\nthese financing receivables. The proceeds from issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $ 494 million. The SPE is\\nwholly owned by us and is consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these financing\\nreceivables are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Energy Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the\\nSPE\\u2019s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPE\\u2019s assets and cash flows are not available to our\\nother creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Energy Asset-backed Notes holders, have no recourse to our\\nother assets. Cash Equity Debt In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries\\nissued $ 502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by,\\namong other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets. 74 China Working\\nCapital Facility In April 2024, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the \\u201cChina Working Capital\\nFacility\\u201d) with lenders in China for an unsecured revolving facility of up to RMB 20.00 billion to be used for certain\\nproduction expenditures as well as repayment of certain finance facilities. Borrowed funds bear interest at a rate equal\\nto the Loan Prime Rate published by the People\\u2019s Bank of China minus 1.18 %. The China Working Capital Facility is non-\\nrecourse to our assets. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had pledged or restricted $ 5.16 billion and\\n$ 4.64 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating lease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted\\ncash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt. Schedule of Principal Maturities of\\nDebt The future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2024 were as follows (in millions): Recourse\\ndebt Non-recourse debt Total 2025 $ 4 $ 2,349 $ 2,353 2026 \\u2014 4,116 4,116 2027 \\u2014 699 699 2028 \\u2014 243 243 2029 \\u2014 95 95\\nThereafter 3 398 401 Total $ 7 $ 7,900 $ 7,907 Note 11 \\u2013 Leases We have entered into various operating and finance lease\\nagreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service locations, data\\ncenters, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or\\ncontains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the\\ndate when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor. We have lease agreements with lease and non-\\nlease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components\\ntogether as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct\\nsales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing\\nand pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease\\ncomponent, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. We have elected not to present short-\\nterm leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception\\nand do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets\\nand lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement\\ndate. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based\\non the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our leases,\\nwhere we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also\\ninclude options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease\\nliabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\\nexercise such options. 75 Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term\\nas cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide\\nfor annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease\\npayments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated\\nlease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the\\nlease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on\\nfinance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the consolidated statements of\\noperations. The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in\\nmillions) within our consolidated balance sheets: December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Operating leases: Operating lease\\nright-of-use assets $ 5,160 $ 4,180 Accrued liabilities and other $ 807 $ 672 Other long-term liabilities 4,603 3,671\\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 5,410 $ 4,343 Finance leases: Solar energy systems, net $ 21 $ 23 Property, plant\\nand equipment, net 350 601 Total finance lease assets $ 371 $ 624 Current portion of long-term debt and finance leases $\\n113 $ 398 Long-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion 222 175 Total finance lease liabilities $ 335 $ 573\\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations: Year\\nEnded December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Operating lease expense: Operating lease expense (1) $ 1,500 $ 1,153 $ 798 Finance\\nlease expense: Amortization of leased assets $ 409 $ 506 $ 493 Interest on lease liabilities 21 45 72 Total finance\\nlease expense $ 430 $ 551 $ 565 Total lease expense $ 1,930 $ 1,704 $ 1,363 (1) Includes short-term leases and variable\\nlease costs, which are immaterial. 76 Other information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\\nDecember 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Weighted-average remaining lease term: Operating leases 7.9 years 7.4 years Finance\\nleases 4.4 years 2.3 years Weighted-average discount rate: Operating leases 5.3 % 5.6 % Finance leases 4.7 % 5.5 %\\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions): Year Ended\\nDecember 31, 2024 2023 2022 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash\\noutflows from operating leases $ 1,450 $ 1,084 $ 754 Operating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments) $\\n21 $ 47 $ 75 Leased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities $ 144 $ 10 $ 58 Leased assets obtained in\\nexchange for operating lease liabilities $ 1,808 $ 2,170 $ 1,059 As of December 31, 2024, the maturities of our\\noperating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions): Operating Leases\\nFinance Leases 2025 $ 1,066 $ 122 2026 958 84 2027 843 69 2028 742 27 2029 642 22 Thereafter 2,428 45 Total minimum\\nlease payments 6,679 369 Less: Interest 1,269 34 Present value of lease obligations 5,410 335 Less: Current portion 807\\n113 Long-term portion of lease obligations $ 4,603 $ 222 As of December 31, 2024, we have excluded from the table above\\nadditional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent payments of $ 1.10 billion. These operating\\nleases will commence between fiscal year 2025 and 2026 with lease terms of 2 years to 20 years. 77 Operating Lease and\\nSales-type Lease Receivables We are the lessor of certain vehicle and solar energy system arrangements as described in\\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . As of December 31, 2024, maturities of our operating lease and\\nsales-type lease receivables from customers for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows (in\\nmillions): Operating Leases Sales-type Leases 2025 $ 1,265 $ 177 2026 777 185 2027 454 93 2028 240 27 2029 200 2\\nThereafter 1,290 \\u2014 Gross lease receivables $ 4,226 $ 484 The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or\\nleasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For our solar PPA\\narrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by the installed solar energy system at a\\npredefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are not included in the\\nabove table as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems in the future. Net\\nInvestment in Sales-type Leases Net investment in sales-type leases, which is the sum of the present value of the future\\ncontractual lease payments, is presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other\\ncurrent assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Lease receivables\\nrelating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): December 31,\\n2024 December 31, 2023 Gross lease receivables $ 484 $ 780 Unearned interest income ( 38 ) ( 78 ) Allowance for expected\\ncredit losses ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Net investment in sales-type leases $ 440 $ 696 Reported as: Prepaid expenses and other\\ncurrent assets $ 152 $ 189 Other non-current assets 288 507 Net investment in sales-type leases $ 440 $ 696 Note 12 \\u2013\\nEquity Incentive Plans In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the \\u201c2019 Plan\\u201d). The 2019 Plan provides\\nfor the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance\\nshares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive\\nstock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory\\nstock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest\\nover four years and our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting\\ntypically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of December 31, 2024, 113.0 million shares\\nwere reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. 78 The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU\\nactivity for the year ended December 31, 2024: Stock Options RSUs Number of Options (in thousands) Weighted- Average\\nExercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in billions) Number of\\nRSUs (in thousands) Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Beginning of period 344,021 $ 35.11 19,088 $ 225.01 Granted\\n14,979 $ 235.22 12,045 $ 223.98 Exercised or released ( 10,469 ) $ 82.04 ( 7,515 ) $ 206.02 Cancelled ( 3,996 ) $ 205.61\\n( 4,957 ) $ 221.15 End of period 344,535 $ 40.41 3.51 $ 125.22 18,661 $ 233.02 Vested and expected to vest, December 31,\\n2024 344,215 $ 40.23 3.50 $ 125.16 18,409 $ 232.99 Exercisable and vested, December 31, 2024 323,847 $ 27.75 3.14 $\\n121.79 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023\\nand 2022 was $ 223.98 , $ 228.33 and $ 239.85 , respectively. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years\\nended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $ 1.75 billion, $ 2.50 billion and $ 4.32 billion, respectively. The\\naggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $ 1.77\\nbillion, $ 1.33 billion and $ 1.90 billion, respectively. ESPP Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock\\nthrough payroll deductions of up to 15 % of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase\\nprice would be 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering\\nperiod. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, under the ESPP we issued 2.2 million, 2.1 million and\\n1.4 million shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there were 95.5 million shares available for issuance under\\nthe ESPP. Fair Value Assumptions We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the\\nfair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance\\nconditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average\\nassumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022\\nRisk-free interest rate 3.92 % 3.90 % 3.11 % Expected term (in years) 4.3 4.5 4.1 Expected volatility 59 % 63 % 63 %\\nDividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Grant date fair value per share $ 114.29 $ 121.62 $ 114.51 The fair value of RSUs with\\nservice or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of\\nour common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes\\nwith maturities approximating each grant\\u2019s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of\\nour employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded\\noptions for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock. 79 Other Performance-Based Grants From\\ntime to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and\\nstock options. As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 490 million under\\nthese grants to purchase or receive an aggregate 5.0 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of\\nachievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 421 million will be recognized over a\\nweighted-average period of 4.0 years. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation\\nexpense related to these grants, net of forfeitures, were not material. Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information The\\nfollowing table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of\\noperations (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Cost of revenues $ 776 $ 741 $ 594 Research and\\ndevelopment 832 689 536 Selling, general and administrative 389 382 430 Restructuring and other $ 2 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 Total $\\n1,999 $ 1,812 $ 1,560 Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements were immaterial\\nwhile we were under full valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nWith the release of the valuation allowance associated with our federal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023,\\nincome tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\\nwere $ 371 million and $ 326 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based\\ncompensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets was $ 198 million, $ 199 million and $ 245 million,\\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $ 5.79 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense\\nrelated to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years. Note 13 \\u2013\\nIncome Taxes Our income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and\\n2022 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Domestic $ 2,292 $ 3,196 $ 5,524\\nNoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest 62 ( 23 ) 31 Foreign 6,636 6,800 8,164 Income before\\nincome taxes $ 8,990 $ 9,973 $ 13,719 80 A provision for (benefit from) income taxes of $ 1.84 billion, $( 5.00 )\\nbillion and $ 1.13 billion has been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $ 332\\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by $ 6.46 billion and $ 1.73 billion during the years\\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024\\nwas primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign\\noperating losses. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the\\nrelease of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. In the fourth\\nquarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable\\nincome in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we\\nconcluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are\\nrealizable and released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the\\nyears ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred\\ntax assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future\\nearnings in the respective jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, we had $ 4.34 billion of federal and $ 8.59 billion\\nof state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, an immaterial amount of which, if\\nnot utilized, will begin to expire in 2026 for federal and 2025 for state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose\\nsubstantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an\\n\\u201cownership change,\\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant\\nlimitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior\\nownership changes or expirations. As of December 31, 2024, we had federal research and development tax credits of $ 1.48\\nbillion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $ 1.01 billion, and state research and development tax credits of $\\n1.06 billion. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized,\\nsome of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2035. However, California research and\\ndevelopment tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest\\nour foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes\\nassociated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely\\nreinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of\\nsuch unrecognized withholding tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $ 309\\nmillion. Uncertain Tax Positions The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2021 $ 531 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 136 Decreases in balances related to\\nprior year tax positions ( 12 ) Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 222 Decreases in balances\\nrelated to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 7 ) December 31, 2022 870 Increases in balances related to prior\\nyear tax positions 59 Decreases in balances related to settlement with tax authorities ( 6 ) Increases in balances\\nrelated to current year tax positions 255 Decreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 4\\n) December 31, 2023 1,174 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 51 Decreases in balances related to\\nprior year tax positions ( 27 ) Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 227 Decreases in balances\\nrelated to settlement with tax authorities ( 4 ) Decreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of\\nlimitations ( 4 ) December 31, 2024 $ 1,417 83 We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in\\nincome tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for\\n(benefit from) income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $ 23 million, $ 17 million and $ 27\\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we have\\naccrued $ 69 million and $ 47 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits.\\nUnrecognized tax benefits of $ 1.14 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We file income tax\\nreturns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal\\nRevenue Service (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to\\n2023 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated\\nto date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent\\ntax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Given the uncertainty in timing and\\noutcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax\\nbenefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time. Note 14 \\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease\\nArrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY\\nFoundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we\\nare continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet\\nemployment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York\\nand spend or incur $ 5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the\\nState of New York during the 10 -year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term,\\nas measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation\\nrequirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of \\u201cprogram payments\\u201d which would not be\\nexpected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New\\nYork, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall\\nagreement to spend or incur $ 5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other\\ncosts in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the\\nrequirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and\\nanticipated level of operations. Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China We have an operating lease arrangement\\nfor an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been\\nconstructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in\\ncapital expenditures by the end of 2023, which was achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax\\nrevenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had met and expect to meet the tax revenue\\nrequirements based on our current level of spend and sales. 84 Legal Proceedings Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO\\nPerformance Award On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the\\nDelaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla\\u2019s board of directors as then constituted, alleging\\ncorporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-\\nbased compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018 (the \\u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\\u201d). Trial was held November 14-18,\\n2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded.\\nPlaintiff\\u2019s counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $ 1,120,115.50 .\\nTesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla\\u2019s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72 % of the disinterested voting\\nshares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\nBecause Tesla\\u2019s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other\\ndirector defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court\\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December\\n2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court\\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded\\nPlaintiff\\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of $ 345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director\\ndefendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court. Litigation Related to Directors\\u2019 Compensation\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly\\non behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\\u2019s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to\\nTesla\\u2019s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and\\nunjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed\\ntheir answer on September 17, 2020. On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and\\nSettlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement,\\nTesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing\\nregarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels\\u2019 fee request\\nunder advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff\\u2019s counsel fees in the\\namount of approximately $ 176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025. Tesla intends to\\nappeal the Court\\u2019s fee award on or before the appeal deadline of February 12, 2025. The settlement is not expected to\\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Litigation Relating to Potential\\nGoing Private Transaction Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were\\nfiled against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk\\u2019s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering\\ntaking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District\\nCourt for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla\\u2019s board of directors. The\\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and\\nother relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November\\n25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the\\ndefendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new\\ntrial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On November 6, 2024,\\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\\u2019s dismissal of all claims. Between\\nOctober 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly\\non behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla\\u2019s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in\\nrelation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits\\nchallenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Several of those actions were consolidated, and\\nall have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February\\n11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and\\nthe members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed. 85\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging,\\namong other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the\\nCompany\\u2019s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company\\u2019s\\ncorporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys\\u2019 fees. The lawsuit has been stayed\\npending resolution of a motion to consolidate certain derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery referenced\\nbelow. On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York\\nalleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014.\\nTesla denied any wrongdoing and filed multiple counterclaims. On November 27, 2024, the parties agreed to settle their\\nclaims. Certain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware Before converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024,\\nthree separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery\\non May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding\\ntopics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including\\nbreach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the\\nplaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court consolidated two of the\\nthree cases. Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment On February 9, 2022, the\\nCalifornia Civil Rights Department (\\u201cCRD,\\u201d formerly \\u201cDFEH\\u201d) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County,\\nCalifornia Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among\\nothers. CRD\\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. Trial\\nis scheduled for September 15, 2025. Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\\u201cEEOC\\u201d)\\nissued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD\\u2019s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed\\na civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting\\nclaims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On June 16,\\n2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of\\nTexas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\\u2019s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims\\nfor breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged\\nrace and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive\\nrelief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys\\u2019 fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two\\ncases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a\\nmotion to dismiss the case and on September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to\\nfile an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla,\\nagainst Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, which the Court granted\\non April 12, 2024, with leave for plaintiffs to amend. On May 15, 2024, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated\\ncomplaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk. On July 1, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the second\\namended consolidated complaint. 86 Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services We are also subject to various\\nlawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other\\nconsumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and\\nservices. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities\\nin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company\\u2019s driver\\nassistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed\\nclass actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief\\non behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022,\\na proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting\\nsimilar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action\\nwith leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla\\nopposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff\\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered\\njudgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for\\nthe Second Circuit, and the parties are briefing the matter. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District\\nof California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term\\n\\u201cFull Self-Driving Capability\\u201d (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD\\nCapability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the\\naccuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the\\nCourt denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed\\nthe claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the\\nNorthern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024,\\nthe Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\\u2019s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was\\nfiled in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal\\ncourt and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court\\nfor the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on\\nJune 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration. On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in\\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and\\nformer Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions\\nabout the Company\\u2019s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of\\npersons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on\\nSeptember 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the\\namended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla\\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26,\\n2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla\\u2019s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of\\nappeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed\\nagainst Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints were\\nalso filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates\\nfederal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other\\nrelief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to\\nMarch 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court\\ngranted Tesla\\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted\\nTesla\\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December\\n12, 2023, which Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court\\u2019s arbitration order, which was denied. On\\nJune 17, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\\u2019s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended\\nComplaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or\\nimpact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims,\\nunless noted. 87 Certain Investigations and Other Matters We regularly receive requests for information, including\\nsubpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the\\nNational Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\u201cSEC\\u201d), the Department of Justice (\\u201cDOJ\\u201d),\\nand various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such\\nas operations, technology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance,\\nfinance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla\\u2019s business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely\\ncooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge\\nno government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the\\noutcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the\\npossibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial\\nposition or brand. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal\\ncourse of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it\\nobtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla\\nhas made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and\\nwe are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed\\nin the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S.\\nindividuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under\\nvarious state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in\\nthese or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact\\non our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand. Letters of Credit As of\\nDecember 31, 2024, we had $ 448 million of unused letters of credit outstanding. Note 15 \\u2013 Variable Interest Entity\\nArrangements We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our\\nsolar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and\\ncontributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that\\nthe funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion\\nunder ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make\\ndecisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated\\ncustomer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer\\nreceivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in\\nnature rather than participating. As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements\\nthe financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and\\ntransactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of\\nincome and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of\\nincome and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor\\u2019s interest in the fund for an amount based on the\\nmarket value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements. Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund,\\ndistributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements. Pursuant to management services,\\nmaintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and\\nmaintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed\\npayments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund\\u2019s creditors have no recourse to our general credit\\nor to that of other funds. Certain assets of the funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations. 88 The\\naggregate carrying values of the VIEs\\u2019 assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and\\nbalances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions): December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Assets\\nCurrent assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 49 $ 66 Accounts receivable, net 18 13 Prepaid expenses and other current\\nassets 276 361 Total current assets 343 440 Operating lease vehicles, net 392 \\u2014 Solar energy systems, net 2,310 3,278\\nOther non-current assets 183 369 Total assets $ 3,228 $ 4,087 Liabilities Current liabilities Accrued liabilities and\\nother $ 32 $ 67 Deferred revenue 6 6 Current portion of debt and finance leases 2,114 1,564 Total current liabilities\\n2,152 1,637 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 71 99 Debt and finance leases, net of current portion 1,834 2,041\\nTotal liabilities $ 4,057 $ 3,777 Note 16 \\u2013 Related Party Transactions Tesla periodically does business with certain\\nentities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as x.AI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X Corp. and Redwood\\nMaterials, in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are\\nnot currently expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 89 Note 17 \\u2013 Segment\\nReporting and Information about Geographic Areas Our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, organizes our company,\\nmanages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and\\n(ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and\\nleasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is\\nalso comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and\\ncollision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy\\ngeneration and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy\\ngeneration and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our CODM does\\nnot evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The CODM uses gross profit to allocate operating\\nand capital resources and assesses performance of each segment by comparing actual gross profit results to historical\\nresults and previously forecasted financial information. The following table presents revenues, cost of revenues and\\ngross profit by reportable segment (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Automotive segment Revenues $\\n87,604 $ 90,738 $ 77,553 Cost of revenues (1) $ 72,794 $ 74,219 $ 56,988 Gross profit $ 14,810 $ 16,519 $ 20,565 Energy\\ngeneration and storage segment Revenues $ 10,086 $ 6,035 $ 3,909 Cost of revenues (2) $ 7,446 $ 4,894 $ 3,621 Gross\\nprofit $ 2,640 $ 1,141 $ 288 (1) Depreciation and amortization included in Cost of revenues for the automotive segment\\nfor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $ 3.68 billion, $ 3.45 billion and $ 2.81 billion,\\nrespectively. (2) Depreciation and amortization included in Cost of revenues for the energy generation and storage\\nsegment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $ 377 million, $ 343 million and $ 331 million,\\nrespectively.

As a result, we recognized\\n$ 583 million of employee termination expenses in Restructuring and other in our consolidated income statement. These\\nexpenses were substantially paid with an immaterial accrual remaining in Accrued liabilities and other in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an impairment\\nloss of $ 204 million as well as realized gains of $ 64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital\\nassets into fiat currency. We also recorded other expenses of $ 36 million during the second quarter of the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, related to employee terminations. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING\\nAND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our\\nmanagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of\\n1934, as amended (the \\u201cExchange Act\\u201d). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our\\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and\\nprocedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its\\njudgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this\\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide\\nreasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and\\nforms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nManagement\\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and\\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process\\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1)\\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts\\nand expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our\\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 91 Under the supervision and with the\\nparticipation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in\\nInternal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (\\u201cCOSO\\u201d). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\\nDecember 31, 2024. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the\\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which\\nis included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of inherent limitations, internal control over\\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree\\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\\n2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\\nreporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None of the Company\\u2019s directors or officers adopted , modified or terminated a\\nRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company\\u2019s fiscal quarter ended\\nDecember 31, 2024, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as follows: On December 6, 2024\\n, Ira Ehrenpreis , one of our directors , adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for the potential exercise of\\noptions to purchase 761,961 shares of our common stock, and the subsequent sale of our common stock subject to certain\\nconditions, in amounts sufficient to cover tax withholding obligations and yield aggregate net proceeds to Mr.\\nEhrenpreis of $15 million, after payment of commissions and fees.

EX-4.72 3\\ntsla-2024x12x31xex472.htm EX-4.72 Document Exhibit 4.72 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT\\u2019S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT\\nTO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 As of January 29, 2025, Tesla, Inc. had one class of common stock\\nregistered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\u201cExchange Act\\u201d). The following\\ndescription of our common stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its\\nentirety by reference to our certificate of formation (the \\u201cCertificate of Formation\\u201d) and our bylaws (the \\u201cBylaws\\u201d),\\neach of which is incorporated herein by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, of which this Exhibit 4.72 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of\\nFormation, our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the \\u201cTBOC\\u201d) for additional\\ninformation. Authorized Capital Stock Our authorized capital stock consists of 6,100,000,000 shares, with a par value of\\n$0.001 per share, of which 6,000,000,000 shares are designated as common stock. The holders of common stock are entitled\\nto one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and do not have cumulative voting rights.\\nAccordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors have the\\npower to elect all of the directors standing for election. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any\\npreferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to receive\\nratably any dividends declared by our board of directors out of assets legally available. Upon our liquidation,\\ndissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after\\npayment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of\\ncommon stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking\\nfund provisions applicable to the common stock. We have certain outstanding securities that may be converted, exercised\\nor exchanged into shares of our common stock. Registration Rights Certain holders of unregistered common stock purchased\\nin private placements, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of such\\nshares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. These rights are provided under the terms of\\nan investors\\u2019 rights agreement between us and the holders of these shares, or the investors\\u2019 rights agreement, and\\ninclude demand registration rights, short-form registration rights and piggyback registration rights. All fees, costs\\nand expenses of underwritten registrations will be borne by us and all selling expenses, including underwriting\\ndiscounts and selling commissions, will be borne by the holders of the shares being sold. The registration rights\\nterminate with respect to an individual holder after the date that is five years following such time when the holder can\\nsell all of the holder\\u2019s shares in any three month period under Rule 144 or another similar exemption under the\\nSecurities Act, unless such holder holds at least 2% of our voting stock. Listing Our common stock is listed on the\\nNasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \\u201cTSLA.\\u201d Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for\\nour common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Anti-Takeover Effects of Texas Law and Our Certificate of\\nFormation and Bylaws Our Certificate of Formation and our Bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect\\nof delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions and certain provisions\\nof Texas law, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover\\nbids. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate\\nfirst with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to\\nnegotiate more favorable terms with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a\\nproposal to acquire us. Limits on Ability of Shareholders to Act by Written Consent or Call a Special Meeting Our\\nCertificate of Formation provides that our shareholders may act by written consent only if all holders of shares\\nentitled to vote on such action adopts a resolution by unanimous written consent. This may deter action by written\\nconsent or lengthen the amount of time required to take shareholder actions. As a result, even a holder controlling a\\nmajority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our Bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our\\nshareholders called in accordance with our Bylaws. In addition, our Certificate of Formation provides that special\\nmeetings of shareholders may be called by the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, the president (to\\nthe extent required by the TBOC), our board of directors, or by shareholders holding not less than 50% (or the highest\\npercentage of ownership that may be set under the TBOC) of the Corporation\\u2019s then outstanding shares of capital stock\\nentitled to vote at such meeting. The threshold required for shareholders to call a special meeting may delay the\\nability of our shareholders to force consideration of a proposal or for holders controlling a majority of our capital\\nstock to take any action, including the removal of directors. Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder\\nNominations and Proposals Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and the\\nnomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of\\ndirectors or a committee of our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of precluding the conduct of\\ncertain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter a\\npotential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise\\nattempting to obtain control of our company. Board Classification Our board of directors is divided into three classes,\\none of which classes is elected each year by our shareholders to serve for a three-year term. A third party may be\\ndiscouraged from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is more difficult and time-\\nconsuming for shareholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board. 2 No Cumulative Voting Our\\nCertificate of Formation and Bylaws do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting\\nallows a shareholder to vote a portion or all of its shares for one or more candidates for seats on the board of\\ndirectors. Without cumulative voting, a minority stockholder may not be able to gain as many seats on our board of\\ndirectors as the shareholder would be able to gain if cumulative voting were permitted. The absence of cumulative voting\\nmakes it more difficult for a minority shareholder to gain a seat on our board of directors to influence our board\\u2019s\\ndecision regarding a takeover. Amendment of Certificate of Formation Provisions The amendment of our Certificate of\\nFormation requires approval by holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote\\ngenerally in the election of directors. Texas Anti-Takeover Statute We are subject to the provisions of Section 21.606\\nof the TBOC regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 21.606 prohibits a publicly held Texas corporation from\\nengaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an affiliated shareholder for a period of three\\nyears following the date the person became an affiliated shareholder unless: \\u2022 prior to the date of the transaction, our\\nboard of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming\\nan affiliated stockholder; or \\u2022 at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by\\nour board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, and not by written consent, by\\nthe affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the affiliated\\nstockholder at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose not less than six months after the affiliated\\nshareholder\\u2019s share acquisition date. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, share exchange, asset or\\nstock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested\\nshareholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the\\ndetermination of interested shareholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation\\u2019s outstanding voting stock. We\\nexpect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of\\ndirectors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that Section 21.606 may also discourage attempts that might\\nresult in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by shareholders. The provisions of Texas\\nlaw and the provisions of our Certificate of Formation and Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from\\nattempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they might also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price\\nof our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions might also have\\nthe effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to\\naccomplish transactions that shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. 3 EX-19 4\\ntsla-2024x12x31xex19.htm EX-19 Document Exhibit 19 TESLA, INC. ___________________ INSIDER TRADING POLICY and Guidelines\\nwith Respect to Certain Transactions in Securities TABLE OF CONTENTS Page INTRODUCTION 1 Legal prohibitions on insider\\ntrading 1 Detection and prosecution of insider trading 1 Penalties for violation of insider trading laws and this Policy\\n1 Insider Trading Compliance Officer 2 Reporting violations 2 Personal responsibility 2 PERSONS AND TRANSACTIONS COVERED\\nBY THIS POLICY 2 Persons covered by this Policy 2 Types of transactions covered by this Policy 3 Responsibilities\\nregarding the nonpublic information of other companies 3 Applicability of this Policy after your departure 3 No\\nexceptions based on personal circumstances 3 MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION 3 \\u201cMaterial\\u201d information 3 \\u201cNonpublic\\u201d\\ninformation 4 POLICIES REGARDING MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION 5 Confidentiality of nonpublic information 5 No trading\\non material nonpublic information 5 No disclosing material nonpublic information for the benefit of others 5 Responding\\nto outside inquiries for information 6 TRADING BLACKOUT PERIODS 6 Quarterly blackout periods 6 Special blackout periods\\n7 Regulation BTR blackouts 7 No \\u201csafe harbors\\u201d 7 PRE-CLEARANCE OF TRADES 7 ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND GUIDANCE 8 Short\\nsales 8 Derivative securities and hedging transactions 8 Using Company securities as collateral for loans 9 Holding\\nCompany securities in margin accounts 9 Placing open orders with brokers 9 LIMITED EXCEPTIONS 9 Transactions pursuant to\\na trading plan that complies with SEC rules 9 Receipt and vesting of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted\\nstock and stock appreciation rights 10 Exercise of stock options for cash 10 Purchases from the employee stock purchase\\nplan 10 Certain 401(k) plan transactions 10 Stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions 11 Inheritance and\\nbona fide gifts 11 Change in form of ownership 11 Other exceptions 11 COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16 OF THE SECURITIES\\nEXCHANGE ACT 11 Obligations under Section 16 11 Notification requirements to facilitate Section 16 reporting 11 Personal\\nresponsibility 12 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 12 Availability of Policy 12 Amendments 12 Ancillary Documents 12 SCHEDULE A\\n(Individuals subject to Section 16 reporting and pre-clearance obligations) SCHEDULE B (Forms of ancillary documents)\\nINTRODUCTION Tesla, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the \\u201c Company \\u201d) opposes the unauthorized disclosure of any\\nnonpublic information acquired in the course of your service with the Company and the misuse of material nonpublic\\ninformation in securities trading. Any such actions will be deemed violations of this Insider Trading Policy (the \\u201c\\nPolicy \\u201d) and you may be subject to disciplinary actions as described below. Legal prohibitions on insider trading The\\nantifraud provisions of U.S. federal securities laws prohibit directors, officers, employees and other individuals who\\npossess material nonpublic information from trading on the basis of that information. Transactions will be considered\\n\\u201con the basis of\\u201d material nonpublic information if the person engaged in the transaction was aware of the material\\nnonpublic information at the time of the transaction. It is not a defense that the person did not \\u201cuse\\u201d the information\\nfor purposes of the transaction. Disclosing material nonpublic information directly or indirectly to others who then\\ntrade based on that information or making recommendations or expressing opinions as to transactions in securities while\\naware of material nonpublic information (which is sometime referred to as \\u201c tipping \\u201d) is also illegal. Both the person\\nwho provides the information, recommendation or opinion and the person who trades based on it may be liable. These\\nillegal activities are commonly referred to as \\u201c insider trading .\\u201d State securities laws and securities laws of other\\njurisdictions also impose restrictions on insider trading. In addition, a company, as well as individual directors,\\nofficers and other supervisory personnel, may be subject to liability as \\u201ccontrolling persons\\u201d for failure to take\\nappropriate steps to prevent insider trading by those under their supervision, influence or control. It is also Company\\npolicy to comply with applicable securities laws concerning trading in Company securities on the Company\\u2019s behalf.\\nDetection and prosecution of insider trading The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\u201c SEC \\u201d), the Financial\\nIndustry Regulatory Authority and the Nasdaq Stock Market use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to\\ninvestigate and detect insider trading, and the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice pursue insider trading violations\\nvigorously. Cases involving trading through foreign accounts, trading by family members and friends and trading\\ninvolving only a small number of shares have been successfully prosecuted. Penalties for violation of insider trading\\nlaws and this Policy Civil and criminal penalties. As of the effective date of this Policy, potential penalties for\\ninsider trading violations under U.S. federal securities laws include: \\u2022 imprisonment; \\u2022 disgorging any profits made or\\nlosses avoided; \\u2022 substantial criminal fines; \\u2022 substantial damages in a private lawsuit; \\u2022 substantial civil fines\\nbased on the profit gained or loss avoided; \\u2022 a bar against serving as an officer or director of a public company; and \\u2022\\nan injunction against future violations. Page 1 Civil and criminal penalties also apply to tipping. The SEC has imposed\\nlarge penalties in tipping cases even when the disclosing person did not trade or gain any benefit from another person\\u2019s\\ntrading. Controlling person liability. As of the effective date of this Policy, the penalty for \\u201ccontrolling person\\u201d\\nliability includes civil fines, as well as potential criminal fines and imprisonment. The civil penalties can extend\\npersonal liability to directors, officers and managers. Company disciplinary actions. If the Company has a reasonable\\nbasis to conclude that you have failed to comply with this Policy, you may be subject to disciplinary action by the\\nCompany, up to and including dismissal for cause, regardless of whether or not your failure to comply with this Policy\\nresults in a violation of law. It is not necessary for the Company to wait for the filing or conclusion of any civil or\\ncriminal action against an alleged violator before taking disciplinary action. In addition, the Company may give stop\\ntransfer and other instructions to the Company\\u2019s transfer agent to enforce compliance with this Policy. Insider Trading\\nCompliance Officer Please direct any questions, requests or reports as to any of the matters discussed in this Policy to\\nthe Company\\u2019s Insider Trading Compliance Officer, who is the Company\\u2019s General Counsel, or in the absence of a General\\nCounsel, someone acting in the General Counsel\\u2019s stead (the \\u201c Insider Trading Compliance Officer \\u201d). The Insider Trading\\nCompliance Officer is generally responsible for the administration of this Policy. The Insider Trading Compliance\\nOfficer may select others to assist with the execution of such Officer\\u2019s duties, each of whom shall also be referred to\\nas the Insider Trading Compliance Officer for purposes of this Policy. Reporting violations It is your responsibility to\\nhelp enforce this Policy. You should be alert to possible violations and promptly report violations or suspected\\nviolations of this Policy to the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. If your situation requires that your identity be\\nkept secret, your anonymity will be preserved to the greatest extent reasonably possible. If you wish to remain\\nanonymous, you may send a letter addressed to the Insider Trading Compliance Officer at Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road,\\nAustin, Texas 78725 or through the Integrity Line pursuant to the reporting procedures set forth in the Company\\u2019s Code\\nof Business Ethics. If you make an anonymous report, please provide as much detail as possible, including any evidence\\nthat you believe may be relevant to the possible violation. Personal responsibility The ultimate responsibility for\\ncomplying with this Policy and applicable laws and regulations rests with you. If securities transactions ever become\\nthe subject of scrutiny, they are likely to be viewed after- the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, you\\nshould use your best judgment at all times and carefully consider how the transaction may be construed in the bright\\nlight of hindsight. We advise you to seek assistance if you have any questions at all and consult with your personal\\nlegal and financial advisors, as needed. The rules relating to insider trading can be complex, and a violation of\\ninsider trading laws can carry severe consequences. PERSONS AND TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY Persons covered by\\nthis Policy This Policy applies to all directors, officers, employees and agents (such as consultants and independent\\ncontractors) of the Company. This Policy also applies to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives\\nin your household, and family members who do not live in your household but whose securities transactions are directed\\nby you or are subject to your influence or control (such as parents or Page 2 children who consult with you before they\\ntrade in Company securities), as well as persons that are your economic dependents and any other individuals or entities\\nwhose transactions in securities you influence, direct or control (including, for example, a venture or other investment\\nfund, if you influence, direct or control transactions by the fund) (such individuals and entities, \\u201c Additional Covered\\nPersons \\u201d). You are responsible for making sure that these Additional Covered Persons comply with this Policy.\\nAccordingly, you should make such Additional Covered Persons aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in\\nCompany Securities, and you should treat all such transaction for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities\\nlaws concerning trading while in possession of material nonpublic information as if the transactions were from your own\\naccount. Types of transactions covered by this Policy Except as discussed in the section entitled \\u201c Limited Exceptions\\n,\\u201d this Policy applies to all transactions involving the securities of the Company or the securities of other companies\\nas to which you possess material nonpublic information obtained in the course of your service with the Company. This\\nPolicy therefore applies to purchases, sales and other transfers of common stock, options, warrants, preferred stock,\\ndebt securities (such as debentures, bonds and notes) and other securities. This Policy also applies to any arrangements\\nthat affect economic exposure to changes in the prices of these securities. These arrangements may include, among other\\nthings, transactions in derivative securities (such as exchange-traded put or call options), hedging transactions, short\\nsales and certain decisions with respect to participation in benefit plans. This Policy also applies to any offers with\\nrespect to the transactions discussed above. You should note that there are no exceptions from insider trading laws or\\nthis Policy based on the size of the transaction. Responsibilities regarding the nonpublic information of other\\ncompanies This Policy prohibits the unauthorized disclosure or other misuse of any nonpublic information of other\\ncompanies, such as the Company\\u2019s distributors, vendors, customers, collaborators, suppliers and competitors. This Policy\\nalso prohibits insider trading and tipping based on the material nonpublic information of other companies. Applicability\\nof this Policy after your departure You are expected to comply with this Policy until such time as you are no longer\\naffiliated with the Company and you no longer possess any material nonpublic information subject to this Policy. In\\naddition, if you are subject to a trading blackout under this Policy at the time you cease to be affiliated with the\\nCompany, you are expected to abide by the applicable trading restrictions until at least the end of the relevant\\nblackout period. No exceptions based on personal circumstances There may be instances where you suffer financial harm or\\nother hardship or are otherwise required to forgo a planned transaction because of the restrictions imposed by this\\nPolicy. Personal financial emergency or other personal circumstances are not mitigating factors under securities laws\\nand will not excuse a failure to comply with this Policy. MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION \\u201cMaterial\\u201d information\\nInformation should be regarded as material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would\\nconsider it important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities or would view the information as significantly\\naltering the total mix of information in the marketplace about the issuer of the Page 3 security. In general, any\\ninformation that could reasonably be expected to affect the market price of a security is likely to be material. Either\\npositive or negative information may be material. It is not possible to define all categories of \\u201cmaterial\\u201d information.\\nHowever, some examples of information that could be regarded as material include information with respect to: \\u2022\\nFinancial results, financial condition, earnings pre-announcements, guidance, projections or forecasts, particularly if\\ninconsistent with the Company\\u2019s guidance or the expectations of the investment community; \\u2022 Restatements of financial\\nresults, or material impairments, write-offs or restructurings; \\u2022 Changes in independent auditors, or notification that\\nthe Company may no longer rely on an audit report; \\u2022 Business plans or budgets; \\u2022 Creation of significant financial\\nobligations, or any significant default under or acceleration of any financial obligation; \\u2022 Impending bankruptcy or\\nfinancial liquidity problems; \\u2022 Significant developments involving business relationships, including execution,\\nmodification or termination of significant agreements or orders with customers, suppliers, distributors, manufacturers\\nor other business partners; \\u2022 Product introductions, modifications, defects or recalls or significant pricing changes or\\nother product announcements of a significant nature; \\u2022 Significant developments in research and development or relating\\nto intellectual property; \\u2022 Significant cybersecurity incidents; \\u2022 Significant legal or regulatory developments, whether\\nactual or threatened; \\u2022 Actual or threatened major litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, or the\\nactual or potential settlement of such litigation, proceedings or investigations; \\u2022 Major events involving the Company\\u2019s\\nsecurities, including calls of securities for redemption, adoption of stock repurchase programs, option repricings,\\nstock splits, changes in dividend policies, public or private securities offerings, modification to the rights of\\nsecurity holders or notice of delisting; \\u2022 Significant corporate events, such as a pending or proposed merger, joint\\nventure or tender offer, a significant investment, the acquisition or disposition of a significant business or asset or\\na change in control of the Company; \\u2022 The existence of a special blackout period; and \\u2022 Major personnel changes, such as\\nchanges in senior management or lay-offs, or changes in the board of directors. If you have any questions as to whether\\ninformation should be considered \\u201cmaterial,\\u201d you should consult with the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. In general,\\nit is advisable to resolve any close questions as to the materiality of any information by assuming that the information\\nis material. \\u201cNonpublic\\u201d information Information is considered nonpublic if the information has not been broadly\\ndisseminated to the public for a sufficient period to be reflected in the price of the security. Information can be\\nbroadly disseminated to the public in a press release, a public filing with the SEC, a pre-announced public webcast or\\nanother broad, Page 4 non-exclusionary form of public communication. You may not attempt to \\u201cbeat the market\\u201d by trading\\nsimultaneously with, or shortly after, the official release of material information. Although there is no fixed period\\nfor how long it takes the market to absorb information, out of prudence a person in possession of material nonpublic\\ninformation should refrain from any trading activity for at least one full trading day following its official release.\\nAny questions as to whether information is nonpublic should be directed to the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. The\\nterm \\u201c trading day \\u201d means a day on which national stock exchanges are open for trading. A \\u201c full \\u201d trading day has\\nelapsed when, after the public disclosure, trading in the relevant security has opened and then closed. POLICIES\\nREGARDING MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION Confidentiality of nonpublic information The unauthorized use or disclosure of\\nnonpublic information relating to the Company or other companies is prohibited. All nonpublic information you acquire in\\nthe course of your service with the Company may only be used for legitimate Company business purposes. In addition,\\nnonpublic information of others should be handled in accordance with the terms of any relevant nondisclosure agreements,\\nand the use of any such nonpublic information should be limited to the purpose for which it was disclosed. You must use\\nall reasonable efforts to safeguard nonpublic information in the Company\\u2019s possession. You may not disclose nonpublic\\ninformation about the Company or any other company, unless required by law, or unless (i) disclosure is required for\\nlegitimate Company business purposes, (ii) you are authorized to disclose the information and (iii) appropriate steps\\nhave been taken to prevent misuse of that information (for example, entering into an appropriate nondisclosure agreement\\nthat restricts the disclosure and use of the information, if applicable). This restriction also applies to internal\\ncommunications within the Company and to communications with agents of the Company. In cases where disclosing nonpublic\\ninformation to third parties is required, you should coordinate with the Legal Department. In addition, all officers,\\nemployees and agents of the Company are required to comply with any confidential information or invention assignment\\nagreement with the Company to which they are subject. No trading on material nonpublic information Except as discussed\\nin the section entitled \\u201c Limited Exceptions \\u201d below, you may not, directly or indirectly through others, engage in any\\ntransaction involving the Company\\u2019s securities while aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company. It\\nis not an excuse that you did not \\u201cuse\\u201d the information in your transaction. Similarly, you may not engage in\\ntransactions involving the securities of any other company if you are aware of material nonpublic information about that\\ncompany (except to the extent the transactions are analogous to those presented in the section entitled \\u201c Limited\\nExceptions \\u201d). For example, you may be involved in a proposed transaction involving a prospective business relationship\\nor transaction with another company. If information about that transaction constitutes material nonpublic information\\nfor that other company, you would be prohibited from engaging in transactions involving the securities of that other\\ncompany (as well as transactions involving Company securities, if that information is material to the Company). It is\\nimportant to note that \\u201cmateriality\\u201d is different for different companies. Information that is not material to the\\nCompany may be material to another company. No disclosing material nonpublic information for the benefit of others Page\\n5 You may not disclose material nonpublic information concerning the Company or any other company to friends, family\\nmembers or any other person or entity not authorized to receive such information where such person or entity may benefit\\nby trading on the basis of such information. In addition, you may not make recommendations or express opinions on the\\nbasis of material nonpublic information as to trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates.\\nYou are prohibited from engaging in these actions whether or not you derive any profit or personal benefit from doing\\nso. This prohibition against disclosure of material nonpublic information includes disclosure (even anonymous\\ndisclosure) via the internet, blogs, investor forums or chat rooms where companies and their prospects are discussed.\\nResponding to outside inquiries for information In the event you receive an inquiry from someone outside of the Company,\\nsuch as a stock analyst, for information, you should refer the inquiry to the Company\\u2019s Investor Relations Department.\\nThe Company is required under Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) of the U.S. federal securities laws to avoid the selective\\ndisclosure of material nonpublic information. In general, the regulation provides that when a public company discloses\\nmaterial nonpublic information, it must provide broad, non-exclusionary access to the information. Violations of this\\nregulation can subject the Company to SEC enforcement actions, which may result in injunctions and severe monetary\\npenalties. The Company has established procedures for releasing material information in a manner that is designed to\\nachieve broad public dissemination of the information immediately upon its release in compliance with applicable law.\\nPlease consult the Company\\u2019s External Communications Policy for more details. TRADING BLACKOUT PERIODS To limit the\\nlikelihood of trading at times when there is a significant risk of insider trading exposure, the Company has instituted\\nquarterly trading blackout periods and may institute special trading blackout periods from time to time. In addition, to\\ncomply with applicable legal requirements, the Company may also institute blackout periods that prevent directors and\\nofficers from trading in Company securities at a time when employees are prevented from trading Company securities in\\nthe Company\\u2019s 401(k) plan It is important to note that whether or not you are subject to a particular blackout period,\\nyou remain subject to the prohibitions on trading on the basis of material nonpublic information and any other\\napplicable restrictions in this Policy. Quarterly blackout periods Except as discussed in the section entitled \\u201c Limited\\nExceptions \\u201d below, all directors and executive officers, and employees and agents identified by the Company must\\nrefrain from conducting transactions involving the Company\\u2019s securities during quarterly blackout periods. Even if you\\nare not specifically identified as being subject to quarterly blackout periods, you should exercise caution when\\nengaging in transactions during quarterly blackout periods because of the heightened risk of insider trading exposure.\\nQuarterly blackout periods begin at the end of the first trading day following the fifteenth day of the last month of\\neach fiscal quarter and end after the first full trading day following public disclosure of the financial results for\\nthat fiscal quarter. This period is a particularly sensitive time for transactions involving the Company\\u2019s securities\\nfrom the perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws due to the fact that, during this period, individuals\\nmay often possess or have access to material nonpublic information relevant to the expected financial results for the\\nquarter. However, irrespective of whether you actually possess, have access to, or access such information, any failure\\nto comply with a quarterly blackout period other than in accordance with the section entitled \\u201c Limited Exceptions \\u201d\\nbelow will be a violation of this Policy. Page 6 From time to time, the Company may identify persons who should be\\nsubject to quarterly blackout periods, and shall notify such persons. Additional Covered Persons associated with such\\nindividuals so notified are also subject to the quarterly blackout periods. Special blackout periods From time to time,\\nthe Company may also prohibit directors, officers, employees and agents from engaging in transactions involving the\\nCompany\\u2019s securities when, in the judgment of the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, a trading blackout is warranted.\\nThe Company will generally impose special blackout periods when there are material developments known to the Company\\nthat have not yet been disclosed to the public. For example, the Company may impose a special blackout period in\\nanticipation of announcing interim earnings guidance or a significant transaction or business development. However,\\nspecial blackout periods may be declared for any reason. The Company will notify those persons subject to a special\\nblackout period. Each person who has been so identified and notified by the Company (and related Additional Covered\\nPersons) may not engage in any transaction involving the Company\\u2019s securities until instructed otherwise by the Insider\\nTrading Compliance Officer. Regulation BTR blackouts Directors and executive officers may also be subject to trading\\nblackouts pursuant to Regulation Blackout Trading Restriction, or Regulation BTR, under U.S. federal securities laws. In\\ngeneral, Regulation BTR prohibits any director or executive officer from engaging in certain transactions involving\\nCompany securities during periods when 401(k) plan participants are prevented from purchasing, selling or otherwise\\nacquiring or transferring an interest in certain securities held in individual account plans. Any profits realized from\\na transaction that violates Regulation BTR are recoverable by the Company, regardless of the intentions of the director\\nor officer effecting the transaction. In addition, individuals who engage in such transactions are subject to sanction\\nby the SEC as well as potential criminal liability. The Company has provided, or will provide, separate memoranda and\\nother appropriate materials to its directors and executive officers regarding compliance with Regulation BTR. The\\nCompany will notify directors and officers if they are subject to a blackout trading restriction under Regulation BTR.\\nFailure to comply with an applicable trading blackout in accordance with Regulation BTR is a violation of law and this\\nPolicy. No \\u201csafe harbors\\u201d There are no unconditional \\u201csafe harbors\\u201d for trades made at particular times, and all persons\\nsubject to this Policy should exercise good judgment at all times. Even when a quarterly blackout period is not in\\neffect, you may be prohibited from engaging in transactions involving the Company\\u2019s securities because you possess\\nmaterial nonpublic information, are subject to a special blackout period or are otherwise restricted under this Policy.\\nPRE-CLEARANCE OF TRADES Except as discussed in the section entitled \\u201c Limited Exceptions \\u201d below, directors and\\nexecutive officers should refrain from engaging in any transaction involving the Company\\u2019s securities without first\\nobtaining pre - clearance of the transaction from the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. In addition, the Company has\\ndetermined that certain other employees and agents of the Company that may have regular or special access to material\\nnonpublic information should refrain from engaging in any transaction involving the Company\\u2019s securities without first\\nobtaining pre - clearance of the transaction from the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. The Insider Trading Compliance\\nOfficer may not engage in a transaction involving the Page 7 Company\\u2019s securities unless the Company\\u2019s Chief Executive\\nOfficer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer or their delegate, or if there are more than one Insider\\nTrading Compliance Officer, another such Insider Trading Compliance Officer, has pre-cleared the transaction.\\nIndividuals subject to pre - clearance requirements are listed on Schedule A . From time to time, the Company may\\nidentify other persons who should be subject to the pre - clearance requirements set forth above, and the Insider\\nTrading Compliance Officer may update and revise Schedule A as appropriate. These pre-clearance procedures are intended\\nto decrease insider trading risks associated with transactions by individuals with regular or special access to material\\nnonpublic information. In addition, requiring pre-clearance of transactions by directors and officers facilitates\\ncompliance with Rule 144 resale restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the liability and\\nreporting provisions of Section 16 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\u201c Exchange Act \\u201d) and\\nRegulation BTR. Pre-clearance of a trade, however, is not a defense to a claim of insider trading and does not excuse\\nyou from otherwise complying with insider trading laws or this Policy. Further, pre-clearance of a transaction does not\\nconstitute an affirmation by the Company or the Insider Trading Compliance Officer that you are not in possession of\\nmaterial nonpublic information. The Insider Trading Compliance Officer is under no obligation to approve a transaction\\nsubmitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND GUIDANCE This\\nsection addresses certain types of transactions that may expose you and the Company to significant risks. You should\\nunderstand that, even though a transaction may not be expressly prohibited by this section, you are responsible for\\nensuring that the transaction otherwise complies with other provisions in this Policy that may apply to the transaction,\\nsuch as the general prohibition against insider trading as well as pre- clearance procedures and blackout periods, to\\nthe extent applicable. Short sales Short sales ( i.e., the sale of a security that must be borrowed to make delivery)\\nand \\u201cselling short against the box\\u201d ( i.e., a sale with a delayed delivery) with respect to Company securities are\\nprohibited under this Policy. Short sales may signal to the market possible bad news about the Company or a general lack\\nof confidence in the Company\\u2019s prospects, and an expectation that the value of the Company\\u2019s securities will decline. In\\naddition, short sales are effectively a bet against the Company\\u2019s success and may reduce the seller\\u2019s incentive to\\nimprove the Company\\u2019s performance. Short sales may also create a suspicion that the seller is engaged in insider\\ntrading. Derivative securities and hedging transactions You are prohibited from engaging in transactions in publicly-\\ntraded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to the Company\\u2019s securities. This\\nprohibition extends to any hedging or similar transaction designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Company\\nsecurities. Stock options, stock appreciation rights, other securities issued pursuant to Company benefit plans or other\\ncompensatory arrangements with the Company, and broad-based index options, futures or baskets are not subject to this\\nprohibition. Transactions in derivative securities may reflect a short - term and speculative interest in the Company\\u2019s\\nsecurities and may create the appearance of impropriety, even where a transaction does not involve trading on inside\\ninformation. Trading in derivatives may also focus attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company\\u2019s\\nlong-term objectives. In addition, the application of securities laws to derivatives Page 8 transactions can be complex,\\nand persons engaging in derivatives transactions run an increased risk of violating securities laws. Using Company\\nsecurities as collateral for loans You should exercise caution in pledging Company securities as collateral for loans.\\nIf you default on the loan, the lender may sell the pledged securities as collateral in a foreclosure sale. The sale,\\neven though not initiated at your request, is still considered a sale for your benefit and, if made at a time when you\\nare aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not permitted to trade in Company securities, may result in\\ninadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and Regulation BTR violations (for officers and directors),\\nviolations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company. Holding Company securities in margin\\naccounts You may not hold Company securities in margin accounts. Under typical margin arrangements, if you fail to meet\\na margin call, the broker may be entitled to sell securities held in the margin account without your consent. The sale,\\neven though not initiated at your request, is still considered a sale for your benefit and, if made at a time when you\\nare aware of material nonpublic information or are otherwise not permitted to trade, may result in inadvertent insider\\ntrading violations, Section 16 violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable\\npublicity for you and the Company. Placing open orders with brokers Except in accordance with an approved trading plan\\n(as discussed below), you should exercise caution when placing open orders, such as limit orders or stop orders, with\\nbrokers, particularly where the order is likely to remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Open orders may\\nresult in the execution of a trade at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not\\npermitted to trade in Company securities, which may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and\\nRegulation BTR violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and\\nthe Company. If you are subject to any blackout periods or pre-clearance requirements, you should inform any broker with\\nwhom you place any open order at the time it is placed of your obligation to comply with such blackout periods and/or\\npre-clearance requirements. LIMITED EXCEPTIONS The following are certain limited exceptions to the restrictions imposed\\nby the Company under this Policy. Please be aware that even if a transaction is subject to an exception to this Policy,\\nyou will need to separately assess whether the transaction complies with applicable law. For example, even if a\\ntransaction is indicated as exempt from this Policy, you may need to comply with the \\u201cshort-swing\\u201d trading restrictions\\nunder Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable. You are responsible for complying with applicable law at\\nall times. Transactions pursuant to a trading plan that complies with SEC rules The SEC has enacted rules that provide\\nan affirmative defense against alleged violations of U.S. federal insider trading laws for transactions pursuant to\\ntrading plans that meet certain requirements. In general, these rules, as set forth in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange\\nAct, provide for an affirmative defense if you enter into a contract, provide instructions or adopt a written plan for\\ntrading securities when you are not aware of material nonpublic information. The contract, instructions or plan must be\\nmade or entered into in good faith and not as a part of a plan or scheme to evade the insider trading laws and must (i)\\nspecify the amount, price and date of the transaction, (ii) specify an objective method for determining the amount,\\nprice and date of the transaction and/or (iii) place any subsequent discretion for determining the amount, price and\\nPage 9 date of the transaction in another person who is not, at the time of the transaction, aware of material nonpublic\\ninformation. Transactions made pursuant to a written trading plan that (i) complies with the affirmative defense set\\nforth in Rule 10b5-1 and (ii) is approved by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, are not subject to the restrictions\\nin this Policy against trades made while aware of material nonpublic information or to the pre- clearance procedures or\\nblackout periods established under this Policy. In approving a trading plan, the Insider Trading Compliance Officer may,\\nin furtherance of the objectives expressed in this Policy, impose criteria in addition to those set forth in Rule\\n10b5-1. Therefore, you must confer with the Insider Trading Compliance Officer prior to entering into any trading plan.\\nNo transactions may occur under such contract, instructions or plans until the expiration of the applicable cooling-off\\nperiod (minimum of 90 days for directors and officers and 30 days for all other employees and agents). The SEC rules\\nregarding trading plans are complex and must be complied with completely to be effective. The description provided above\\nis only a summary, and the Company strongly advises that you consult with your personal legal advisor if you intend to\\nadopt a trading plan. While trading plans are subject to review and approval by the Company, the individual adopting the\\ntrading plan is ultimately responsible for compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and ensuring that the trading plan complies with\\nthis Policy. Trading plans must be filed with the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. The Company may publicly disclose\\ninformation regarding trading plans that you may enter into. Receipt and vesting of stock options, restricted stock\\nunits, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights The trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the\\ngrant or award to you of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights by the\\nCompany. The trading restrictions under this Policy also do not apply to the vesting, cancellation or forfeiture of\\nstock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights in accordance with applicable plans\\nand agreements. However, the trading restrictions do apply to any subsequent sales of any such securities. Exercise of\\nstock options for cash The trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the exercise of stock options for cash\\nunder the Company\\u2019s stock option plans. Likewise, the trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the\\nexercise of stock options in a stock-for-stock exercise with the Company or an election to have the Company withhold\\nsecurities to cover tax obligations in connection with an option exercise. However, the trading restrictions under this\\nPolicy do apply to (i) the sale of any securities issued upon the exercise of a stock option, (ii) a cashless exercise\\nof a stock option through a broker, since this involves selling a portion of the underlying shares to cover the costs of\\nexercise, and (iii) any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an\\noption. Purchases from the employee stock purchase plan The trading restrictions in this Policy do not apply to\\nelections with respect to participation in the Company\\u2019s employee stock purchase plan or to purchases of securities\\nunder the plan. However, the trading restrictions do apply to any subsequent sales of any such securities. Certain\\n401(k) plan transactions The trading restrictions in this Policy do not apply to purchases of Company stock in the\\n401(k) plan resulting from periodic contributions to the plan based on your payroll contribution election. The trading\\nrestrictions do apply, however, to elections you make under the 401(k) plan to (i) increase or decrease the Page 10\\npercentage of your contributions that will be allocated to a Company stock fund, (ii) move balances into or out of a\\nCompany stock fund, (iii) borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in liquidation of some\\nor all of your Company stock fund balance, and (iv) pre-pay a plan loan if the pre- payment will result in the\\nallocation of loan proceeds to a Company stock fund. Stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions The trading\\nrestrictions under this Policy do not apply to a change in the number of securities held as a result of a stock split or\\nstock dividend applying equally to all securities of a class, or similar transactions. Inheritance and bona fide gifts\\nThe trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution. In\\naddition, bona fide gifts involving Company securities are not transactions subject to this policy, unless you have\\nreason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company securities while you are aware of material nonpublic\\ninformation. Change in form of ownership Transactions that involve merely a change in the form in which you own\\nsecurities are not subject to the trading restrictions under this Policy. For example, you may transfer shares to an\\ninter vivos trust of which you are the sole beneficiary during your lifetime. Other exceptions Any other exception from\\nthis Policy must be approved by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, in consultation with the Board of Directors or\\nan independent committee of the Board of Directors. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT\\nObligations under Section 16 Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the related rules and regulations, set forth (i)\\nreporting obligations, (ii) limitations on \\u201cshort-swing\\u201d transactions and (iii) limitations on short sales and other\\ntransactions applicable to directors, officers, large shareholders and certain other persons. The Board of Directors of\\nthe Company has determined that the persons specified as Section 16 insiders on Schedule A are required to comply with\\nSection 16 of the Exchange Act, and the related rules and regulations, because of their positions with the Company. The\\nInsider Trading Compliance Officer may amend Schedule A from time to time as appropriate to reflect the election of new\\nofficers or directors, any change in the responsibilities of officers or other employees and any promotions, demotions,\\nresignations or departures. Schedule A may not necessarily contain an exhaustive list of persons subject to Section 16\\nrequirements at any given time. Even if you are not listed on Schedule A , you may be subject to Section 16 reporting\\nobligations because of your shareholdings, for example. Notification requirements to facilitate Section 16 reporting To\\nfacilitate timely reporting of transactions pursuant to Section 16 requirements, each person subject to Section 16\\nreporting requirements must provide, or must ensure that such person\\u2019s broker provides, the Company with detailed\\ninformation ( e.g., trade date, number of shares, exact price, etc. ) regarding such person\\u2019s transactions involving the\\nCompany\\u2019s securities, including gifts, transfers, pledges and Page 11 transactions pursuant to a trading plan, both\\nprior to (to confirm compliance with pre-clearance procedures, if applicable) and promptly following execution. Personal\\nresponsibility The obligation to file Section 16 reports, and to otherwise comply with Section 16, is personal. The\\nCompany is not responsible for the failure to comply with Section 16 requirements. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Availability\\nof Policy This Policy will be made available to all directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company when they\\ncommence service with the Company. Each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company is required, if requested,\\nto acknowledge that he or she understands, and agrees to comply with, this Policy. Amendments We are committed to\\ncontinuously reviewing and updating our policies and procedures. The Company therefore reserves the right to amend,\\nalter or terminate this Policy at any time and for any reason, subject to applicable law.
